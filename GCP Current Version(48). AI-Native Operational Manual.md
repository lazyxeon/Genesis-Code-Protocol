Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) V48 — AI-Native Operational Manual

Edition: V48.0 — “Contradiction → Deployment → Evolution”
Lineage: Evolutionary enhancement of V47.2 (no regressions), with explicit, first-class integration of TRIZ/ARIZ, C-K theory, futures/morphological exploration, multi-agent adversarial wargaming, and a formal Devastation Protocol.
Audience: Large Language Models (primary executors), human operators/reviewers (secondary overseers).
Purpose: A single, self-contained guidebook enabling any competent LLM (with or without external tools) to invent, design, simulate, validate, package, and field solutions under rigorous governance, auditable ledgers, explicit safety case, and continuous evaluation.
Operating Constraint: No dependency on external tools or repos. If tools exist, they act as accelerators—not requirements.
Design Principle: Every phase/subphase/gate is explicit. No implied steps. No placeholders. No streamlining.

0. Orientation & Execution Contract

0.1 Protocol Goals (for the AI)

1. Think Rigorously — Prefer evidence, statistics, falsification, and adversarial checks over intuition.


2. Be Realistic — Choose the smallest viable intervention that works in the real world.


3. Ship Responsibly — Produce artifacts a competent team can validate and deploy without gaps.


4. Stay Auditable — Record assumptions, decisions, and evidence in structured ledgers.


5. Protect Users — Treat safety, privacy, security, fairness, and compliance as first-class deliverables.



0.2 Modes of Operation

Full Run Mode (FRM) — Halt at every checkpoint; present Context Recap and Next Moves; wait for explicit user command:

proceed 1
branch Phase <n>
return C#.#  
end & export

Auto Mode (AM) — Auto-progress past routine checkpoints. Stop if (a) a gate requires human judgment, (b) section is marked manual, or (c) a critical risk triggers a stop.


Mode Switching

User → AI: "switch to auto mode" / "switch to full run mode"

AI → User:

FRM→AM: “Routine checkpoints detected; switching to Auto Mode unless told otherwise.”

AM→FRM: “Critical decision required at C#.#; switching to Full Run Mode.”



0.3 Checkpoint Structure (Universal; copy verbatim)

⛔ CHECKPOINT C#.# — <Name>

Context Recap:
- Objectives completed since last checkpoint
- Key artifacts produced (short filenames)
- Open assumptions / uncertainties
- Risks or blockers

Next Moves (choose one):
1) Proceed to <Phase/Subphase> — <action>
2) Branch to <Phase/Subphase> — <alternate path>
3) Return to C#.# — <reason>
4) End & export — <manifest name>

How to respond:
proceed 1
branch Phase <n>
return C#.#  
end & export

[Mode: Full Run | Auto]
[Auto Mode Active: AI will choose option <x> unless overridden]

0.4 Artifact Conventions (Self-Contained)

Run ID: short alphanumeric (e.g., S48).

File Naming: RunID_Phase.Subphase_Artifact_Short.ext (e.g., S48_3.1_Constraint_Ledger.md).

Primary Ledgers (07_ledgers/)

RUN_LEDGER.md — chronological actions & major events

DECISION_LEDGER.md — branch choices + rationale (incl. AM logs)

ASSUMPTION_LEDGER.md — A/B/C assumptions + test status

EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md — sources, statistics, outcomes

BENCHMARK_LEDGER.md — baselines, SOTA, metrics

OPTIMIZATION_LEDGER.md — before/after metrics (C8.5)

RISK_SAFETY_LEDGER.md — hazards, mitigations, test status

COMPLIANCE_LEDGER.md — privacy, licensing, regulatory notes

NEW V48:

CONTRADICTION_LEDGER.md — TRIZ/ARIZ resolution work

C_K_LEDGER.md — Concept–Knowledge maps, drift bridges

MORPH_FUTURES_LEDGER.md — scenarios, morph tables, selections

ADVERSARY_LEDGER.md — consolidated Red Team logs (4.A, 6.5, 13.5, 14.5)




0.5 Risk Tiers & Rigor

R1 (Low) — N≥15 reps, ≥5 seeds; integrity-lite; basic security scans.

R2 (Moderate) — N≥30 reps, ≥10 seeds; full integrity; SBOM/signing; SemVer compatibility.

R3 (High/Regulated) — N≥50 reps, ≥20 seeds; FMEA/STPA/GSN/DPIA/HIL; continuous assurance by default.


0.6 Worth-It & Decision Scoring

Worth-It Score (WIS) — normalized composite of expected value, feasibility, adoption realism (0–1).

Expected Value Modeling (EVM) — (outcome × probability) − (cost × risk weight).

Forecast Calibration — track with Brier score over time.

Minimal-Intervention Principle — prefer smallest solution that passes gates.


0.7 Graph-Enhanced Reasoning (Optional)

If tools exist, generate per-phase graphs (textual GraphML outline acceptable): community detection (clusters/gaps), centrality (rank focal constraints), diversity metrics (avoid tunnel vision). Log outcomes textually even if no visuals.

---

29. Minimal-Intervention Track (Always Available)

Maintain a non-intrusive fallback (advisory-only mode, manual ops support, signage/alerts) that can be fielded with low risk.

If innovation benefit doesn’t materialize quickly, recommend fallback without stalling user value.

Inclusion Rules (Quick)

Everything generated goes into RunID_FinalPackage/ under the appropriate directory.

No secrets included; only 03_configs/secrets.TEMPLATE.env.

Evidence & stats backing gate decisions live in 06_evidence/ and are referenced from EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md.

SBOM & signatures (R2+) in 09_security_provenance/.

Field realism (C6.9) evidence spans 11_product/ and 12_field_kit/.

Safety Case & C9 material must be complete before release is considered signed.

Export checkpoint recaps to 18_logs/checkpoints/ to enable seamless resume outside chat.
