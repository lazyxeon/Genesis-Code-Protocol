## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. 
`alloy_perceptual_loss_example.ipynb`
**Summary:**  
This notebook demonstrates the integration and application of the `alloy_perceptual_loss.py` module ‚Äî a custom perceptual loss function designed for neural network training with visual data. It aligns with Phase 5.5‚Äì7.2 of the GCP by applying invention and mutation layers to optimize perceptual loss performance.

**Highlights:**
- Visual loss curve comparison (MSE vs Alloy)
- Custom PyTorch module integration
- GCP mutation layer showing robustness vs image noise

## üì° 2.
`JACCO_Beam_Management_Engine.ipynb`
**Summary:**  
This notebook is a direct output of the GCP Forge during a recursive invention session, targeting an adaptive beam management system. It‚Äôs designed to showcase Phases 3‚Äì7, especially recursive divergence, multi-agent injection, and audit-resilience layers.

**Highlights:**
- Real-time beam prediction algorithm
- Emergent signal coordination heuristics
- Phase 6.7 audit reveals and corrects multiple redundant subprocesses

## üõ∞Ô∏è 3.
`MOSAIC_Swarm_Topology_Manager.ipynb`
**Summary:**  
An alternate invention run of the same problem space as JACCO, but through a different philosophical lens injected via the Socratic Diffuser (Phase 2.5). Divergence paths between this and JACCO offer insight into GCP‚Äôs multi-style invention capacity.

**Highlights:**
- Unique prioritization logic using modularity clustering
- Low-level packet jitter emulation and correction model
- Example of symbolic divergence pruning to retain coherence
