Gate C0 — Init 

Persona: GCP Orchestrator (sticky until STOP). 

Run seed: 45.5-R1. 

Modes armed: Agents/Web/File I/O/Canvas/Colab (conceptual). 

Goal: Invent a novel AI architecture that optimizes neglected latent capabilities of LLMs. 

Next: Phase 1 (SOTA/gap scan). 

Type CONTINUE (or AMEND {…} to add constraints like latency, cost, privacy). 

--- 

Phase 1 — SOTA & Gap Scan (web-grounded) 

Quick literature anchors (recent & canonical): 

Structured deliberation: Tree-of-Thoughts shows big gains by exploring multiple reasoning paths 

with self-evaluation.  

Self-reflection / episodic textual memory: Reflexion agents improve by converting feedback into 

internal notes—no weight updates needed.  

Tool use: Toolformer trains LMs to call external APIs autonomously (search, calculators, etc.).  

World models: learning compact dynamical models to plan/“dream” improves policy learning and 

sample efficiency.  

Interpretable latent features: sparse autoencoders (SAEs) recover monosemantic features and 

can scale; useful for routing/steering.  

Observed gaps (opportunities): 

1. Latent feature under-use: LLMs rarely expose/route on interpretable features discovered by 

SAEs; most routers are top-k token/salience, not feature-aware.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. Deliberation isn’t first-class: ToT-style search is often prompt-level glue, not an architectural 

controller that allocates compute adaptively.  

3. Tool use ≠ model of the world: Toolformer adds APIs, but agents still lack a compact world 

model to simulate consequences or check consistency.  

4. Reflection is ephemeral: Reflexion stores text notes; few systems ground them to stable 

latent slots that influence routing/decoding.  

Problem framing: design an architecture that reads, writes, routes, and plans in the latent space 

(not just tokens), making deliberation, tools, and a lightweight world model first-class modules. 

Gate C1 — Status: PASS. 

Next: Phase 2 (designs). Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 2 — Proposed Architecture (shortlist) 

A. LOGIC: Latent Operator Graph (LOG) 

A modular graph over interpretable latent features, with: 

SAE Feature Bank: sparse codes φ(x) with monosemantic features; online-updated.  

Feature Router 𝑅: routes tokens/queries based on φ(x) to specialist “operators” (deliberation, 

tool, world-sim, critics). 

Deliberation Controller 𝑫 (ToT-native): expands partial solutions as latent thoughts, not only text; 

prunes via critics.  

Tool & Program Operator 𝑇: learns API schemas; receives explicit latent intents from 𝑅 

(Toolformer-style but feature-conditioned).  

World Model 𝑾: compact state-space that simulates downstream effects; queried during 

planning to veto inconsistent branches.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Self-Reflection Memory 𝑴: compresses Reflexion notes into stable latent slots that bias 𝑅 and 

the decoder in future tasks.  

Consistency Critics 𝑪: metamorphic & algebraic checks (e.g., invariances, unit consistency); 

learn to down-weight violating paths. 

Neglected-capability bet: feature-level routing + latent-space ToT + world-model veto. 

B. ALT: SAE-MoE Hybrid (SMoE) 

Use SAE features as gating keys for sparse experts; cheaper than LOGIC but lacks world-sim. 

Pick: LOGIC (primary), SMoE (fallback for edge devices). 

Gate C2 — Status: PASS (primary = LOGIC). 

Next: math + training sketch. Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 2b — Math sketch (concise) 

Let base transformer give hidden h(cid:0). Train SAE to get sparse code φ(cid:0) = SAE(h(cid:0)) with L1 

sparsity and dictionary D. Route via: 

gating logits: g(cid:0) = w(cid:0)·φ̄, where φ̄ aggregates over a span; choose operator k by top-p over 

softmax(g). 

controller ToT: maintain a set of latent partials {zᵢ}; expansion operator proposes Δz; critic C 

scores sᵢ = f(φ(zᵢ), invariants). Search budget B allocated adaptively by entropy over g. 

world check: simulate zᵢ through 𝑾 for k steps; veto if predicted constraint violation. 

Training: multi-objective 

\mathcal{L}=\lambda_{\text{tok}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}} 

+\lambda_{\text{sae}} \|\!h - D\phi\!\|_2^2 + \alpha\|\phi\|_1 

+\lambda_{\text{route}} \text{InfoNCE}(\phi \rightarrow k) 

+\lambda_{\text{inv}} \text{MetamorphicPenalty} 

--- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Phase 3 — Synthesis (reference outline) 

Data/compute assumptions: retrofit onto an existing open model (for research). Pipeline: 

1. Train SAE on layer-k activations → export dictionary D, encoder E.  

2. Insert Router R that reads φ and dispatches to operators (ToT, Tool, World, Critics). 

3. Implement ToT-latent beam with small branching factor + learned scoring.  

4. Add Toolformer-style API head with schema tokens, but key it on φ as well.  

5. Train a tiny world model (state-space or VAE-RNN) for the domain.  

6. Reflexion→Latent: compress reflection notes with E to a small persistent slot that biases R.  

Artifacts to produce: SAE weights, router head, controller, tool head, tiny world model, critic 

suite. 

Gate C3 — Status: PASS (design implementable). 

Next: adversarial shakedown. Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 4 — Devastation (micro) 

Failure modes we’ll attack early: 

Feature leakage or collapse (SAE learns spurious clusters). Mitigation: shuffled activation 

training + sparsity schedules.  

Controller thrash (ToT blowing budget). Mitigation: entropy-based budget, branch culling.  

Tool hallucination (spurious API calls). Mitigation: train on real API errors; require critics to 

confirm pre/post-conditions.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

World-model over-confidence. Mitigation: uncertainty gates; only veto when CI excludes 

consistency. 

Gate C4 — Status: PASS (risks identified + mitigations). 

Next: pre-benchmark “Reality Check”. Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 5 — Reality Check (fast proxies) 

Proxies before heavy training: 

Ablation sanity: router off vs on should not degrade easy tasks; on hard tasks, budget 

reallocation should help (measure steps-to-solve with/without ToT).  

MR tests: metamorphic constraints (e.g., unit conversions, symmetry of simple equations) to 

ensure critics actually down-weight violations. 

Tool API sandbox: seed Tool head with calculator/search; ensure failure-aware retries 

(Toolformer style).  

Latent persistence: Reflexion→latent improves second-attempt success on structured tasks.  

Gate C5 — Status: PASS (prototype tests defined). 

Next: benchmark plan. Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 6 — Benchmark & Compare (plan) 

Reasoning/Tool tasks: GSM8K (few-shot), Game-of-24/ToT tasks, open-book QA with 

calculators/search.  

Planning/World tasks: small grid-world or text-based environments (tiny world-models).  

Metrics: exact-match, steps, tool-success rate, critic veto accuracy, compute per solve, ablation 

deltas (−ToT, −World, −Critics, −SAE). 

Success bar: ≥15–25% relative gain on hard instances at fixed or lower compute (per-token 

FLOPs), and lower failure on MR tests. 

Gate C6 — Status: PASS (clear acceptance). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Next: risk/compliance. Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 7 — Risks & Governance (sketch) 

Safety: critics + MR suite reduce confident nonsense; log tool I/O for audits. 

Licenses: ensure datasets/APIs allow research use. 

Ethics: features are interpretable (SAE), enabling better red-teaming/diagnostics.  

Gate C7 — Status: PASS. 

Next: Product hooks. Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 8 — Productization Hooks 

Minimal interfaces: route(x), deliberate(z), tool(intent), simulate(state, act), reflect(note)->slot. 

Telemetry: branch counts, critic vetoes, API error rates, MR violations. 

Repro kits: seeds, SAE dict hashes, config files. 

Gate C8 — Status: PASS. 

Next: Release. Type CONTINUE. 

--- 

Phase 9 — Release & Handoff 

Primary proposal: LOGIC — Latent Operator Graph 

Why it’s novel/useful: it operationalizes neglected LLM capacities—interpretable latents, 

deliberation as a controller, tool use with pre/post conditions, and a tiny world model for 

consistency checks—into a single, modular architecture. It stands on strong priors (ToT, 

Reflexion, Toolformer, SAEs, world models) but re-wires the control loop to be feature-first, not 

token-first.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Open research items (first sprints): 

Where in the stack to tap activations for the SAE (layer and width).  

Budgeting policies for latent-ToT (learned vs. heuristic).  

Tool schemas and guardrails (contract-checking).  

Small world-model selection (SSM vs. VAE-RNN) for text environments.  

Gate C9 — Status: PASS (design locked; ready for prototyping). 

--- 

What you have now 

A web-grounded gap analysis (with citations). 

A concrete architecture (LOGIC) that elevates latent features, structured deliberation, tool 

pre/post-conditions, and a tiny world model. 

A training + eval plan with acceptance bars and ablations. 

Clear risks/mitigations and product hooks. 

If you want me to turn this into a Colab notebook skeleton (SAE pretrain + toy router + 

latent-ToT over a math sandbox), say BUILD COLAB. If you want a paper-style write-up or a 

patentability screen, say WRITE PAPER or PATENT SCAN. 

Your move: CONTINUE, AMEND { constraints }, or BRANCH "SMoE" for the lightweight variant. 

Awesome—here’s a Colab you can run end-to-end for the “novel AI architecture that optimizes 

latent, neglected capabilities” idea. It’s a compact, runnable prototype that: 

discovers sparse features from a tiny pretrained LM’s hidden states, 

learns which features align with “arithmetic vs. retrieval” tasks, 

routes each prompt to the best skill (calculator / retrieval / multi-draft deliberate LM), and 

evaluates routing + answers on toy tasks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also grounded the approach in recent research (Tree-of-Thoughts, Reflexion, Toolformer, 

sparse autoencoders/monosemantic features) so you’ve got a trail of receipts. 

Download the Colab notebook 

Download LATCH_v1_colab.ipynb 

Open it in Google Colab and just run top→bottom. It installs lightweight deps and runs on CPU. 

What’s inside (quick tour) 

Sparse feature discovery: MiniBatch Dictionary Learning stands in for a fast sparse autoencoder 

to expose “atoms” on a small model (Tiny-GPT2). 

Feature→skill probe: A linear probe correlates sparse atoms with task labels (arith vs. retrieval). 

Latent router: Uses the probe’s confidence to route to: 

a calculator tool (for arithmetic), 

a tiny retrieval helper (keyword index over a mini corpus), or 

deliberate LM multi-draft (Tree-of-Thoughts/Reflexion-style small self-scored sampling) when 

uncertain. 

Evaluation & plots: Accuracy on toy items + a routing distribution bar chart. 

Artifacts: A small JSON summary with dictionary shape and probe accuracy. 

If you want me to extend the notebook (e.g., add a tiny long-context reasoning task, swap the 

dictionary learner for a PyTorch sparse autoencoder, or add a lightweight web search tool shim), 

say the word—I’ll patch it in.
