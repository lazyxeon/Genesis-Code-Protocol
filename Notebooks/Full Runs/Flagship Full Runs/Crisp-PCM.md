Gate Card — CHECKPOINT C−1.0 “Prompt Surface & Acceptance Harness”
Options:
Proceed to Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (once Spark is provided).


Branch to Phase −1 (rework) — tighten invariants/policies before research.


Return to C−1.0 — update RUN CONFIG (Runner/Cartridges/Constraints).


End & export — emit current artifacts and terminate.


Recommendation: 1 — Proceed after Spark is set.
 Confidence: 0.91 | Cost/Time: S | Risk if wrong: weak scoping bleeds into phases 1–3.

Awesome—GCP V49 (Flagship) is live in Auto mode with Auto runner selection. I’m selecting the FoodTech/Packaging Runner and locking the known issue as:
Problem: Fried foods (fries, tenders, wings) arrive soggy in delivery due to steam condensation trapped in hot, sealed packaging. Venting helps, but often cools food too fast or isn’t enough. Retail BrewAviko Food ServiceAnchor Packaging

Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (fast pass)
Root cause. Freshly fried foods outgas moisture; sealed containers trap vapor, which condenses and wets the crust. Purposeful venting reduces condensation. Retail BrewAviko Food ServiceGenpak


Existing tactics. Vented pizza boxes/containers, anti-fog lids, “crisp” clamshells; results vary across materials. Jet Paper BagsSmartbagInline PlasticsAnchor Packaging


Thermal management. Phase-change materials (PCMs) can hold temperature without active power; bio/food-safe fatty-acid PCMs (e.g., lauric, palmitic, stearic) are studied extensively. MDPI+1PMCScienceDirect


Humidity control. Food-grade silica gel is widely used/described as GRAS/FDA-compliant when properly enclosed and separated from food. MultisorbNo.1 Non woven fabric ManufacturerStream PeakHumi Pak


Venting membranes. Hydrophobic ePTFE vents allow vapor/gas exchange while resisting liquid ingress—common in packaging/sterile air applications. Membrane SolutionsDonaldson Filtration Solutions+1


Gate G1 — Pick the angle:
Vent-only container; 2) Sorbent-only insert; 3) Hybrid thermal–vent–sorbent (recommended); 4) Defer.
 Recommendation: 3, to control all three variables: temperature, humidity, and airflow. Confidence: 0.86.



Phase 2 — Concepts (3)
C1. VENT+RACK: Elevated mesh + tuned vents → cheaper, but limited when delivery times exceed ~20 min. Anchor Packaging
 C2. SORBENT LID: Isolated desiccant bay in lid + vents → lowers RH, but risk if sachet contacts food; must be isolated. (Prior art exists.) Free Patents Online
 C3. CRISP-PCM™ (chosen):
PCM plate (bio-based fatty-acid blend) tuned to ~58–62 °C to keep internal air above dew point while avoiding over-steaming,


Hydrophobic ePTFE micro-vents to bleed vapor,


Isolated food-grade silica-gel bay (no contact with food),


Elevated chimney-lattice tray that channels moist air upward to vents. PMCMDPIMembrane SolutionsDonaldson Filtration SolutionsMultisorb


Gate G2 — Move forward with C3? → Yes (Auto).

Phase 3 — System Design (MVP v1)
Architecture (stack, bottom→top):
PCM base tile (encapsulated fatty-acid PCM; clip-in, dishwasher-safe shell for reuse in pro kits, or disposable thin-pack for QSR). Target melt ≈ 60 °C (palmitic-stearic blend). ScienceDirectMDPI


Chimney-lattice tray (perforated “egg-crate” geometry) elevates food 10–12 mm, creating vertical convective channels to the lid.


Lid with ePTFE vents (2–4 discs, 8–10 mm) positioned above chimneys; hydrophobic barrier resists grease/aerosols while passing vapor. Membrane SolutionsDonaldson Filtration Solutions


Isolated desiccant bay (snap-closed micro-chamber in lid; holds <2 g food-grade silica gel in sachet; never contacts food). Multisorb


Anti-fog inner surface option on lid to suppress droplet coalescence. Inline Plastics


Bill of materials (core): PCM tile, PP/CPET tray & lid, ePTFE vent discs (adhesive-backed), 2 g silica-gel sachet (food-grade), anti-fog additive film. em8p26t79wg.exactdn.com
Why this should work: Maintain air warm (PCM), keep RH lower (desiccant), and give vapor a preferential escape path (chimneys→vents). Published packaging tests show “crisp” designs outperform on texture over 30–40 min routes when condensation is mitigated. Anchor Packaging

Phase 4 — Red-Team (quick)
Safety/compliance: Desiccant must be enclosed & labeled; no direct contact with food. ePTFE vent adhesives must be food-contact compliant on non-contact exterior. Multisorb


PCM leakage risk: Use encapsulated fatty-acid PCMs; consider secondary hermetic shell. (Fatty-acid PCMs are studied but can leak without encapsulation.) MDPI


Cost/complexity: Added BOM (PCM + vents) vs. uplift in NPS/return orders.


Thermal trade-off: Too-hot air increases vapor output; tuning melt point (~60 °C) is key. ScienceDirect



Phase 5 — MVP Test Plan (2-week sprint)
Design of experiments: 2×2×2 factorial
PCM (on/off) × Vents (on/off) × Desiccant (on/off).
 Menu items: skin-on fries, breaded tenders, battered fish.
 Metrics:


Crispness/Texture via Texture Analyzer 3-point bend/penetration at 0, 20, 40 min;


Mass gain (condensation re-uptake) %;


Surface water activity (a_w);


Panel (9-pt crispness).
 Success criteria: ≥25% higher crispness at 30 min vs. best vent-only control; ≥15% lower lid condensate mass; temp ≥54 °C at 30 min.



Phase 6 — Optimization Levers
PCM melt point/blend (lauric/palmitic/stearic ratios) and mass. ScienceDirect


Vent count/placement and membrane pore spec (ePTFE flow vs. grease barrier). Donaldson Filtration Solutions


Desiccant mass & bay geometry; anti-fog coating grade. Inline Plastics



Phase 7 — Packaging & GTM

What you’re getting (quick highlights)
Problem framing: Sealed hot foods trap steam; as air cools to the dew point inside the box, condensation forms and soaks the crust—classic soggy-fry failure mode. Venting and moisture control reduce condensation. The Washington PostRetail BrewGenpak


Chosen concept: A hybrid of (1) a ~60 °C fatty-acid PCM tile to keep headspace warm, (2) hydrophobic ePTFE micro-vents in the lid to bleed vapor while resisting liquid ingress, (3) an isolated desiccant bay in the lid, and (4) an elevated chimney-lattice tray that channels vapor up to the vents. PCMs in the 30–70 °C band are well-studied; fatty-acid and paraffin classes offer high latent heat suitable for passive thermal buffering. ScienceDirect+1PMC


Materials & compliance:


Base/Lid/Tray: food-contact PP/CPET (21 CFR §177.1520 and §177.1630). eCFRLegal Information Institute


Vents: ePTFE membranes (Donaldson/Porex class) mounted externally so adhesives remain non-contact. Donaldson Filtration Solutions+1Porex


Desiccant: silica gel/bentonite in sealed sachets (indirect food-contact widely used; silicon dioxide is a permitted food additive under §172.480 in direct uses like anticaking). eCFRU.S. Food and Drug AdministrationLegal Information Institute


Anti-fog option: inner-lid anti-fog film/coating to suppress droplet coalescence. Avient+1


Instrumented testing baked in: Crispness by three-point bend (Texture Analyzer), optional acoustic capture; water activity (a_w) with Aqualab; temp, condensate mass, and sensory panel. These are standard, published methods. ScienceDirectWiley Online Librarystablemicrosystems.comAQUALAB


Reference geometry: Standard 9″×9″×3″ hinged clamshell envelope (common in PP offerings)—the drawings include a lid with three Ø10 mm vent locations and a 40×22×6 mm desiccant bay. sabert.comWebstaurantStore


Notes on the spec
The PCM is fully encapsulated and never contacts food; the tray and lid are the only food-contact surfaces (PP/CPET per CFR). eCFRLegal Information Institute


ePTFE vents are hydrophobic vapor-permeable membranes used across packaging and device venting; you’ll select a flow spec with your vendor during pilot sourcing. Donaldson Filtration Solutions+1


Desiccant use is indirect (in a sealed bay, no contact). Silicon dioxide (silica) is permitted as a food additive under §172.480 in direct applications like anticaking; as a desiccant it’s commonly used in indirect contact when properly enclosed and labeled. eCFRU.S. Food and Drug Administration
