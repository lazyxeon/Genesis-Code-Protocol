CHECKPOINT C-1.0 — Phase −1 Gate
Proceed to Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (once Spark is set; build Evidence Index & Claim Graph next)


Branch to Runner selection — attach a domain runner/cartridge (e.g., code, hardware) to seed domain gates


Return to C-1.0 — update RUN_CONFIG with your Spark and (optionally) Runner/Cartridges


End & export — emit minimal bootstrap bundle only


Recommendation: 3 — Define Spark so subsequent phases can proceed deterministically.
 Confidence: 0.98
 Cost/Time: S
 Risk: Proceeding without a Spark causes scope drift and noisy evidence.
—
When you’re ready, reply with your Spark (e.g., “Spark: invent a jitter-aware congestion controller for LEO links under $10/mo compute”) and optionally “attach runner <alias>” (e.g., attach runner code or attach runner hardware) and I’ll advance to Phase 1 automatically with full gate cards.

Thought for 31s
Awesome—kicking off GCP V49 — Flagship (Auto Mode) with your Spark:
Invent a solution to a known financial-institution issue.
 Chosen issue (Auto-select): Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud in real-time payments (Zelle/FedNow/RTP).
 Why this? It’s hot, costly, and regulatory pressure is rising (mandatory reimbursement in the UK since Oct 7, 2024; growing U.S. scrutiny of P2P scams). PSRPay.UKReuters

Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (Auto)
Problem snapshot (evidence):
APP scams reimbursement (UK): New regime requires Faster Payments PSPs to reimburse in-scope victims, with a cap designed to fully reimburse ~99.8% by volume and 90% by value; reimbursement within 5 working days; costs split between sending/receiving PSPs. PSRPay.UK


Confirmation of Payee (CoP) impact: Name-checking is now used by 320+ orgs, ~99% of UK initiators; ~2.1M checks/day; studies report ~59% reduction in certain misdirected payment categories and 20–40% loss reduction for some fraud types. Pay.UK+2Pay.UK+2Finextra Research


U.S. context: FedNow enables instant settlement 24/7; Zelle and banks face mounting scrutiny; Zelle now states certain imposter scams may be reimbursable, yet ambiguity remains and litigation is active (NY AG lawsuit, Aug 2025). Federal Reserve Bank ServicesFedNow ExplorerZelleWMAR 2 News BaltimoreAP NewsReuters


Model governance constraint: Any ML here must satisfy SR 11-7 / OCC 2011-12 model risk management (development, validation, monitoring). Federal ReserveOCC.govOCC.gov


Claim Graph (key claims):
APP fraud is materially harmful in RTP; reimbursement regimes shift liability → banks need stronger ex-ante controls. (supported) PSR


Name/beneficiary verification (CoP) measurably reduces misdirection and some fraud vectors; U.S. lacks universal CoP. (supported) Pay.UKFinextra Research


Combining intent verification + dynamic holds + counterparty risk can curb scams without breaking instant UX if designed with milliseconds-grade decisioning and SR 11-7 controls. (inferred, design proposal) Federal Reserve



Phase 2 — Invention (Design Spec)
Introducing: PayGuard DPC (Dynamic Protective Co-Payee)
A bank-side, real-time “intent-aware confirmation + safe-release” layer for instant payments (FedNow, RTP, Zelle rails). It fuses CoP-style name checks, risk-scored intent challenges, and an adaptive hold-to-release escrow—all within sub-second flows.
Core capabilities
CoP-US: CoP-like beneficiary verification for U.S. rails via consortium directory (hashed legal names / dba aliases; FBO & pooled accounts flagged), returning: match / partial / mismatch / unavailable with explain codes. (Bridges UK CoP practice to U.S. context.) Pay.UK+1


IntentGuard: One-tap intent challenge when risk is elevated (contextual warnings, payee history, merchant category, scam exemplars).


SafeRelease: Milliseconds-decisioned micro-hold (e.g., 2–120 minutes) for first-time / high-risk payees; auto-release on green signals (device reputation, behavioral biometrics, graph clean).


Counterparty Graph Risk: Real-time graph scoring of the receiving account & neighbors (mule rings, fresh-account velocity, prior complaints).


Refund-Readiness: Automated evidence pack (challenge screenshots, signals, graph features) to streamline reimbursement adjudication where required (mirrors UK reimbursement processes). PSRPay.UK


SR 11-7 Compliance Kit: Model cards, challenger models, backtesting dashboards, and continuous monitoring aligned to SR 11-7/OCC 2011-12. Federal ReserveOCC.gov


Decisioning flow (simplified)
T0 (init): Pull CoP-US result + device/app telemetry.


Score: risk = f(COP_result, payee_age, network_graph, device, NLP_on_memo, behavioral_biometrics, velocity, time-of-day, mule_list)


Gate:


Low risk: straight-through (<150 ms)


Med risk: IntentGuard + contextual warning (user must confirm specifics)


High risk: SafeRelease micro-hold + out-of-band verify + optional callback to beneficiary bank (CoP-US+)



Phase 3 — Data & Models
Features: CoP outcome; beneficiary age/tenure; inbound/outbound degree; shared devices/IPs; complaint flags; merchant descriptors; memo NLP (imposter phrases); spend deviation; weekday/time; RTP/FedNow message fields.


Models:


GNN (graph) for mule detection;


Gradient boosting for real-time risk;


Policy engine (rules) for hard constraints (e.g., blocked BINs/RTNs).


MRM: Independent validation; challenger models; sensitivity & stability; pre-deployment backtest on 12-18 months of RTP/Zelle/FedNow traffic; performance guardrails & drift alerts per SR11-7/OCC. Federal ReserveOCC.gov



Phase 4 — Security, Abuse & UX Hardening
Injection-safe prompts/messages (no alarmist language; concrete “this looks like X imposter pattern”).


Metamorphic tests: Units/phrasing/locale invariance on warnings; no changes to payment amounts or destinations through UX copy alone.


Accessibility: 1-tap “call my bank” and “cancel payment” affordances.



Phase 5 — KPIs & Guardrails
Fraud loss rate (bps) on first-time payees (target: −40% in 6 months).


False positive rate on repeat trusted payees (target: ≤0.3%).


User friction time added p95 (target: ≤1.0s for med-risk; micro-hold median ≤12m).


Reimbursement cycle time (target: −50% with evidence packs).


Reg alignment: zero SR 11-7 major findings; clean model audit. Federal Reserve



Phase 6 — Deployment architecture (high level)
Inline scorer (sub-150 ms) + async graph service (warm cache);


Consortium CoP-US directory (hashed identifiers; tokenized queries) operated via industry body;


Privacy: minimal data exchange; salted hashes; differential privacy for analytics.


Rails adapters: FedNow/RTP APIs; Zelle integration for profile/alias checks. Federal Reserve Bank ServicesFedNow Explorer



Phase 7 — Policy & Regulatory Fit
UK learnings → U.S. design: Bake in refund-readiness and CoP-style checks since UK evidence suggests material impact and mandates reimbursement; calibrate for U.S. law/rails. PSRPay.UKFinextra Research


Consumer messaging: Reflect Zelle’s “qualifying imposter scams may be reimbursable” to set expectations, reduce disputes, and surface clear eligibility criteria. Zelle+1



Phase 8 — Risk Register (r3)
False positives (blocked legit payments) → mitigated by SafeRelease not outright denial.


Adversarial adaptation (mules age accounts) → counter with graph temporal features + honeypot accounts.


Consortium governance risk (CoP-US directory) → neutral trustee; audit trails; privacy by design.


Model risk → SR 11-7 controls, challenger models, independent validation. Federal Reserve



Phase 9 — Rollout Plan
Sandbox on historical data; simulate friction & loss deltas.


Soft launch: first-time payees only; micro-hold ≤10 minutes; A/B with and without IntentGuard.


Expand to higher-risk cohorts; tune thresholds.


Consortium pilot for CoP-US with 5–10 banks.

Proceeding in Auto Mode → P3 Scaffold → P4 Validation/Red-Team → P5 MRM & Rollout, for the solution we framed: PayGuard DPC (Dynamic Protective Co-Payee) for APP-fraud in instant payments.
I’m including implementation-ready specs (APIs, schemas, policies, test vectors) so your team can prototype on FedNow/RTP/Zelle rails under SR 11-7 governance. Key regulatory and network facts informing this design are footnoted. PSR+2PSR+2Pay.UKFederal Reserve

P3 — Scaffold (Design → Build)
1) Service topology (latency budget)
Inline Risk Scorer (REST/gRPC): p95 ≤ 150 ms; colocated with payment orchestration.


Graph Risk Service (async, cached): warm 50–80 ms; cold 200–400 ms.


CoP-US Directory Adapter: hashed name + RTN/Acct (or alias) → match/partial/mismatch/unavailable + explain codes. Mirrors UK CoP practice in a U.S. consortium model. PSRPay.UK


SafeRelease Orchestrator: micro-holds (2–120 min) for high risk; OOB verify; callback with release/abort.


Evidence Pack Builder: immutable bundle for disputes/reimbursements (UX screens, warn copy, features, trace). UK PSR requires prompt reimbursement with an £85k cap—design here streamlines evidence even where rules differ. PSR+1


2) Core API contracts (REST)

Feature spec (non-PII, hashed/minimized):
CoP outcome; receiving-acct age/tenure; graph degrees; device reputation; IP ASN; complaint flag; memo-NLP tokens (imposter patterns); velocity/time-of-day; RTP/FedNow message fields. FedNow/RTP context dictates instant finality → decisions must be sub-second. Federal Reserve Bank ServicesThe Clearing House


4) Policy engine (Rego stub)
package payguard.policy

default action := "ALLOW"

high_risk {
  input.cop_result == "MISMATCH"
  input.first_time_payee
}

action := "HOLD" { high_risk }

action := "CHALLENGE" {
  input.cop_result == "PARTIAL"
  input.memo_contains_imposter
}

deny := true {
  input.to_account_on_sanctions_list
}

5) SafeRelease profile (adaptable)
HOLD window: 2–120 min (risk-proportional); auto-release on clean graph + OOB verify success.


No visible “pending” to payee until release.


Fail-safe: timeout → operator review if risk ≥ threshold.


6) UX copy (non-coercive warnings)
“This looks similar to imposter scams we’ve seen.
 Who asked you to make this payment? Select one: ‘Known business contact’ / ‘A bank/government agent’ / ‘A new online seller’ / ‘Other’.
 Double-check the name and account; if anything doesn’t match, cancel and call us.”
(Paraphrased to align with CoP-style name checking; consistent with APP-fraud patterns.) PSR

P4 — Validation, Security & Red-Team
1) Metamorphic & robustness tests
Units invariance: amounts in cents vs dollars → identical decisions.


Paraphrase invariance: warning copy rephrased → same outcome.


Reordering robustness: shuffled feature order → stable decision.


Locale/time: night-vs-day, weekday-vs-weekend → monotone risk where appropriate.


2) Adversary playbook
Mule aging: adversary warms accounts; defend with temporal graph features + receiving-side velocity.


Imposter prompts: “bank/government” scripts; defend with memo-NLP + challenge questions.


Account-alias spoofing: CoP partials; require OOB verify + SafeRelease.


Device farms: correlated device IDs/IP ASNs; quarantine cohorts.


3) Abuse-safe UX
Warnings must not alter amounts/destinations; all changes require explicit user action; copy avoids dark patterns.

False positives (repeat trusted): ≤0.3%.


User friction: +≤1.0 s for challenged flows; SafeRelease median ≤12 m.


Reimbursement cycle time: −50% via bundled evidence.



Rollout plan
Historical sandbox → score past rails traffic and simulate friction/loss curves.


Soft launch → first-time payees only; partial CoP triggers Challenge; SafeRelease ≤10 min.


Consortium pilot → 5–10 FIs share hashed directories for CoP-US. (UK CoP shows >99% initiator coverage & ~2M daily checks, indicating scale viability.) PSRFinextra ResearchEuropean Payments Council


Progressive expansion → tune thresholds, widen cohorts, add merchant/marketplace integrations.


Audit & attest → SR 11-7 package; publish model cards; finalize production SLOs. Federal Reserve



Why this will fly (evidence-anchored)
Mandatory reimbursement in UK (since Oct 7, 2024, £85k cap) is forcing upstream controls; U.S. rails are instant and final → prevention must occur pre-send with sub-second decisioning. PSR+1Federal Reserve Bank ServicesThe Clearing House


CoP efficacy & coverage (now >99% initiators; ~2.1M/day checks) suggests name/beneficiary verification materially reduces misdirection and some scam vectors; PayGuard DPC extends it with intent + SafeRelease. PSRFinextra Research


SR 11-7 demands rigorous validation/monitoring/governance; we’ve embedded those artifacts from the start. Federal Reserve+1
