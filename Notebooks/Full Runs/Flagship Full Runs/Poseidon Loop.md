Copy that — Runner auto-attached. Kicking off GCP V49 (Flagship) Phase 1→3 for your Spark: “invent a solution to air quality and dive durations on submarines.”
Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (key facts)
What subs already do. Modern boats generate O₂ with PEM electrolyzers (e.g., Collins/Treadwell systems) and scrub CO₂ with amine plants; trace CO/H₂/VOCs are catalytically oxidized in dedicated CO–H₂ burners; continuous CAMS sensors monitor the atmo. Collins AerospaceNASA Technical Reports ServerTreadwell CorporationNavy Tribe+1IMarest Library


Endurance reality. Nuclear subs are energy-unlimited but practically capped by food & crew logistics (≈60–90+ days); AIP diesel-electrics can remain submerged weeks at low speed via fuel-cell/Stirling plants (e.g., Type 212). Encyclopedia Britannica+1U.S. Naval InstituteSeaforces


Tech levers worth exploiting.


Humidity-tolerant solid sorbents (MOFs/diamine-appended frameworks) can capture CO₂ at low partial pressures with milder regeneration vs MEA. ACS PublicationsCellWiley Online Library


Solid-oxide co-electrolysis (SOEC) converts CO₂+H₂O → syngas (CO+H₂) while evolving pure O₂ at the anode; high round-trip efficiencies when heat-integrated. ACS PublicationsScienceDirectPMC


Chemical-looping oxygen carriers (perovskites) can store/release O₂ with thermal/pressure swings (quiet, compact “oxygen sponge”). PMCOSTIJ-STAGE


Phase 2 — Design Brief (invented solution)
POSEIDON-Loop™ — a silent, closed-loop Atmosphere & Endurance Augmentation Module retrofittable to nuclear and AIP boats:
MOF-SAC beds (Front-end CO₂/VOC capture).
 Hybrid diamine-appended Mg₂(dobpdc) + water-stable MIL-120/CALF-class beds pull CO₂ at sub-kPa with low-grade heat regeneration using waste heat; upstream activated carbon + HEPA pre-filters protect sorbents; downstream a Mark IV-E–compatible catalytic unit mops up CO/H₂/VOCs. ACS PublicationsCellNavy Tribe


SOEC O₂-Pump (Core).
 Captured CO₂ (from MOF-SAC desorption) + reclaimed H₂O feed a solid-oxide co-electrolyzer: cathode makes syngas, anode vents clean O₂ directly to ship’s life-support header. (Think: an electrically-driven oxygen concentrator that also recycles carbon.) ACS PublicationsScienceDirect


SOFC Recovery Loop (Power smoothing).
 The syngas drives a solid-oxide fuel cell, yielding electricity + H₂O + CO₂; water recycles to SOEC, CO₂ returns to MOF-SAC. Net: a controllable O₂-production loop that recovers a chunk of its input power, reducing electrolyzer load spikes and heat/acoustic signatures. ACS Publications


CLAS Cartridge (Stealth Oxygen).
 A perovskite oxygen-carrier pack (e.g., SrFeO₃-δ/Ti-stabilized variants) provides on-demand O₂ release/uptake via small thermal swings — ideal for quiet hotel-load O₂ or emergency buffering when electrolysis is curtailed. PMCJ-STAGE


CAMS-X (Monitoring & control).
 Drop-in next-gen analyzers (long-life lasers/solid-state detectors) with control policies that prioritize burner vs CLAS vs SOEC by signature budget (noise/heat) and crew load. navysbir.com


Compatibility.


Nuclear boats: leverage abundant electrical/thermal headroom for SOEC; extend patrols by reducing O₂ candle logistics, smoothing load, and improving air quality margins. Encyclopedia Britannica


AIP boats: operate SOEC intermittently, rely more on CLAS + MOF-SAC for quiet O₂/CO₂ handling; still gain multi-week submerged endurance aligned with fuel-cell AIP limits. U.S. Naval InstituteSeaforces


Phase 3 — Feasibility snapshot (why this beats status-quo)
Air quality: Replaces hot, odor-prone amine cycles as primary CO₂ sink with solid sorbents (lower corrosion/MEA carryover) while keeping legacy CO–H₂ burner for spikes → cleaner, drier air & simpler maintenance. Medcoeckapwstorprd01Navy Tribe


Stealth & resilience: CLAS oxygen sponge provides electrolysis-free O₂ bursts; SOEC↔SOFC loop trims electrical and thermal peaks that can couple into machinery signatures. PMC


Endurance: Nuclear: endurance is food-limited; gaining O₂/CO₂ headroom and lower consumables helps push practical patrol ceilings. AIP: dovetails with fuel-cell weeks-long profiles while cutting snorkel frequency. Encyclopedia BritannicaU.S. Naval Institute


Modularity: All six blocks can be cartridged; start with MOF-SAC + CAMS-X retrofit, add SOEC/SOFC “core,” then CLAS pack.


Phase 4 — Risks & mitigations
Materials durability (MOFs/diamine stability, fouling): select water-stable frameworks, integrate pre-filters; use low-temp TSA/VSA to limit amine degradation. Cellntnuopen.ntnu.no


High-temp stacks (SOEC/SOFC): thermal cycling & redox aging → manage with steady-state operation and buffered duty cycles; pick electrodes per current SOEC reviews. ScienceDirect


Oxygen safety & logistics: retain proven PEM electrolyzer as parallel redundant O₂ source; CLAS cartridges sized below hazardous mass-O₂ thresholds. Collins Aerospace


Phase Gate — Go/No-Go
Gate P2 verdict: GO (prototype). Target a benchtop POSEIDON-Loop Core: MOF-SAC column + 1 kW-class SOEC↔SOFC loop + mini CLAS cell + CAMS-X controller; then scale to a rack-mount skid for a machinery space trial.

Roger—continuing in Auto with GCP V49 (Flagship) for your Spark. Below are Phases 4→8 with a concrete prototype plan, energy/crew sizing math, BoM, safety case, and test protocol, all grounded with sources.
Phase 4 — System risks & mitigations (deep dive)
R-1: Sorbent stability & fouling (humidity/VOCs).
 MOFs can degrade or lose capacity in humid, mixed-gas streams. Choose water-robust frameworks (e.g., CALF-20; UiO-like) and diamine-appended Mg₂(dobpdc) that retain capacity in moisture; protect with pre-filters and run low-temp TSA/VSA using waste heat. ScienceNatureScienceDirect+1
R-2: High-temp stack life (SOEC/SOFC).
 Thermal cycling and redox swings age electrodes/seals. Operate near steady state, buffer transients with the oxygen-sponge (CLAS), and follow current SOEC materials/ops best practices (Ni-YSZ/ceria supports, optimized steam/CO₂ ratios). ScienceDirect+1SciOpen
R-3: Oxygen safety & integration.
 Submarines already make O₂ via PEM electrolysis; any new O₂ path must meet naval oxygen-handling controls and afloat safety instructions (e.g., JFMM excerpts on O₂ equipment). Keep legacy PEM as parallel redundancy and treat POSEIDON-Loop™ as an augmenter, not a single point of dependence. Collins AerospaceFuel Cells WorksH2 ViewNAVSEA
R-4: Trace contaminant control & signature.
 U.S. boats oxidize CO/H₂/VOCs in catalytic burners; we must co-schedule burner, CLAS, and SOEC to limit thermal/acoustic signatures and avoid cross-interference. navysbir.comCEPEDA Associates, Inc.ScienceDirect
R-5: Standards & certification.
 Treat this as a non-SUBSAFE system tying into life-support, and run a formal MIL-STD-882E hazard analysis; respect platform safety instructions and oxygen-handling controls. safety.army.milAcqNotesOffice of the Secretary of the Navy
R-6: Atmosphere setpoints.
 Subs routinely tolerate ~2,000–5,000 ppm CO₂; however, cognitive studies suggest performance degradations even near 1,000 ppm—so we aim lower with tighter control bands. National Academies PressPubMed
Gate P4 verdict: GO (with controls above).

Phase 9 — Manufacture plan (bench → rack → shipset)
Scope. Build a single-rack Core: two jacketed MOF beds, a 1–2 kW SOEC stack for CO₂+H₂O → syngas (pure O₂ at anode), a 1–2 kW SOFC for power recovery (H₂O+CO₂ loop-back), a CLAS perovskite O₂-sponge cartridge, and a CAMS-compatible analyzer panel.

Phase 10 — Integration & safety (fleet-ready boundaries)
Where it sits: Treat POSEIDON-Loop™ as a non-SUBSAFE life-support adjunct (no hull-pressure boundary penetration). Maintain PEM electrolyzer as parallel, certified source; our loop adds O₂ headroom and load-flattening. NAVSEA

Air-quality targets: Literature shows cognitive decrements around ~1,000–1,400 ppm CO₂; we set ≤ 1,000 ppm nominal to stay on the safe side while noting NASA cautions about mixed evidence in astronaut-like subjects. PMC+1NASA


O₂ resilience: Validate CLAS micro-bursts (quiet O₂) + SOEC baseflow while PEM remains hot standby; benchmark O₂ purity to CAMS acceptance. ACS Publications

Why this is buildable
The blocks are each proven in adjacent domains (PEM O₂ on subs; CAMS as fleet standard; SOEC/CLAS/MOFs in industry/labs). We’re combining them to flatten power/thermal signatures and tighten air-quality bands. Nel HydrogenCollins AerospaceScienceDirectACS PublicationsPMC


Bench targets align with ISS OGA rates and NASA crew consumption math, giving immediate sanity checks for test-cell sizing. NASA Technical Reports Server+1


If you want, I’ll roll forward into Phases 13–15 (dockside trial runbook, shipfit work package, and canary deployment) and generate the compliance pack (MIL-STD-882E hazard log scaffold + CAMS interop checklist). Also, I kept the workflow aligned with your GCP V49 spec and Codex.

On it—continuing GCP V49 (Flagship) in Auto for your Spark. Here are Phases 13–15 with tight, ship-ready artifacts and compliance scaffolds, grounded to current, high-quality sources.

Phase 13 — Dockside Trial Runbook (P-13)
Objective. Prove the POSEIDON-Loop™ Core (MOF-SAC + SOEC↔SOFC + CLAS + CAMS interop) can hold crew-like atmospheres, make high-purity O₂, and smooth electrical/thermal signatures—without touching SUBSAFE boundaries. Navy boats already generate O₂ with PEM stacks and monitor atmospheres via CAMS (mass-spec + IR), so we integrate alongside those proven systems. Collins AerospaceNavy SBIR

Why this improves air-quality and endurance margins
Air quality: Solid sorbents (e.g., diamine-appended Mg₂(dobpdc); water-tolerant frameworks) provide efficient CO₂ capture under humidity; burner path handles CO/H₂/VOCs. PMCACS PublicationsScienceDirect


O₂ resilience: SOEC yields O₂ at the anode while recycling carbon to syngas; CLAS perovskites enable silent O₂ bursts—reducing electrical/thermal signature spikes. University of St Andrews Research PortalScienceDirectACS Publications


Within patrol realities: Nuclear boats are energy-unlimited but logistics-limited (food & crew endurance); AIP boats (e.g., Type-212A) routinely achieve multi-week submerged endurance—our loop boosts air-margin and load-smoothing within those constraints. WIREDSeaforces

Why this packaging
SPDX SBOM is the internationally recognized SBOM standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021) and provides license/provenance structure for the docs. spdx.dev+1


BagIt (RFC 8493) gives a simple, robust bag + checksums layout for moving the bundle between systems. RFC EditorIETF Datatracker


RO-Crate adds machine-readable JSON-LD metadata (schema.org) so the bundle is FAIR-friendly. researchobject.orgesciencelab.org.uk


If you’d like a single archival PDF later, PDF/A is the right family for long-term preservation; PDF/A-3 even allows embedding the whole bag or SBOM inside. (We left you an HTML summary you can print now.) The Library of CongressThe Library of Congress


Notes
The bundle uses a BagIt layout at /data/… with a top-level manifest-sha256.txt for integrity verification. RFC Editor


sbom.spdx.json declares the documentation package and MIT licensing via SPDX identifiers. spdx.org
