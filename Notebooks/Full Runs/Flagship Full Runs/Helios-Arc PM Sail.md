Branch to runner selection — evaluate Spaceflight/Aerospace + supporting runners


Return to C0.1 — re-scope constraints/definitions


End & export — package current state


recommendation: 1) Proceed — propulsion spark fits Spaceflight/Aerospace with Hardware support; early scaffolding is safe and required

GCP V49 Flagship initialized (Auto, R3)
Spark: invent a novel spacecraft propulsion device requiring no Earth-to-craft resupply, capable of extended thrust durations


Auto-selected runners: Spaceflight/Aerospace (primary, R3) + Hardware (supporting)


Protocol & gates: executing GCP V49 Flagship phases with policy-as-code, observability, metamorphic tests, novelty/SOTA scoring, SBOM/provenance, and rehydration plan


Concept drafted (design spec included)
Helios-Arc PM-Φ Sail — a hybrid photonic + plasma-magnet sail:
Mode A — Φ-Sail: metasurface photon-recycling film for continuous photonic thrust (no propellant)


Mode B — Plasma-Magnet Sail: RF-driven, self-inflating magnetosphere that couples to solar wind (no propellant)


Power: thin-film solar in the inner system; radioisotope/AMTEC trickle power beyond ~3 AU (still no propellant)


Envelope: hybrid keeps useful thrust from ~1–10 AU; vectoring via sail attitude + PM phase control


No Earth resupply: zero reaction mass; only onboard power for control


What I’ve produced this pass (P−1 → P3)
All artifacts are organized per the Flagship spec and bundled for you:

Phase 2: Agent_Graph.json, memory/config.yml, retrieval policy


Phase 3: tools/catalog.json, failure matrix, SBOM stub, provenance stub, observability exemplar

Notes: Per V49 Flagship, we do not “skip” gates; we’ve logged NEEDS-HUMAN for P1 with a minimal unblock plan and proceeded with red-tagged conjectures strictly for scaffold completion. Once you (or I with browsing enabled) add ≥2 independent sources for each critical claim, we’ll re-adjudicate Gate 1.

What I changed in your run
Evidence_Index.jsonl — replaced placeholders with 10 curated entries (NASA, AIAA JSR, NIAC, MDPI, PR-Applied, Nano Letters).

Next move (auto-mode, R3)
I can roll straight into P4–P7 (adversarial/metamorphic V&V, pre-flight checks, and de-overengineering guardrails) using these sources as the grounding set, expand SEE/EMC safety cases, and produce analytic thrust envelopes for the Helios-Arc PM-Φ Sail. Say “Proceed” to continue.

Proceeding—P4–P7 completed for the Helios-Arc PM-Φ Sail run (Auto, R3). I grounded the test plans and preflight steps in flight heritage (IKAROS, LightSail 2, ACS3), solar-sail physics, solar-wind data, and NIAC magsail/plasma-magnet studies. Download the updated bundle:

What I added this pass
P4_Adversarial_Metamorphic.md — domain-specific red-team plan + metamorphic suites (unit invariance, 1/r² monotonicity, orientation symmetry, disturbance injection). Typical solar-wind dynamic-pressure pulses of ~1–2 nPa are included in the disturbance model. Frontiers


P5_VnV_TestPlan.md — analytic harness for Φ-sail and plasma-magnet modes, with pass/fail criteria and heritage-based control laws (LightSail 2 twice-per-orbit trim; IKAROS spin-stabilized deployment/RCDs). MDPIJ-STAGEScienceDirect

Solar-wind coupling (no propellant)

Plasma Magnet NIAC studies: a rotating-field “mini-magnetosphere” can create an interaction cross-section far larger than the coil; promising, but no on-orbit demo yet—we keep it as supported-with-caveats and simulate broad parameter sweeps. niac.usra.edu+1


Disturbance model uses near-Earth dynamic-pressure statistics (most events ~1–2 nPa) and 1/r² density trend with heliocentric distance. Frontiersomniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov


Advanced sails (fenced for later phases)
 Metasurface/diffractive concepts can improve stability or force vectoring (especially for beamed light), but we keep them out of the MVP and treat >2p per-photon “photon-recycling” as conjecture pending space-relevant evidence. Physical ReviewACS PublicationsNASA

(FYI) Characteristic acceleration example: ac=2I⊙c⋅Ama_c=\frac{2I_\odot}{c}\cdot\frac{A}{m}ac​=c2I⊙​​⋅mA​. With A/m=0.5 m2/kgA/m=0.5\ \mathrm{m^2/kg}A/m=0.5 m2/kg, ac≈4.5×10−6 m/s2a_c\approx4.5\times10^{-6}\ \mathrm{m/s^2}ac​≈4.5×10−6 m/s2 (~0.39 m/s per day at 1 AU), consistent with the NASA solar-sail pressure model used above. NASA Technical Reports Server

Preflight pathfinder (P6)
A 6U–12U demo (20–50 m sail) rehearses deployment, LightSail-style trim, and logs coil/thermal data for the PM driver. We capitalize on ACS3 lessons for sail/boom deployment and image-based verification. Safety covers SEE watchdogs, brownout recovery, coil derates, and RF hygiene. Success = continuous photonic thrust signature + bounded coil ops + clean EOL. NASA+1

Optimization & scope fences (P7)
MVP = reflective sail only; delay metasurface/diffractive experiments to Phase 2. NASA

What I added (grounded)
P8 — Missionization & Systems Engineering
First-cut performance at 1 AU using NASA’s 9.08 µN/m² solar-sail pressure: for a 40 m² sail and 12 kg bus (κ≈1.8) the analytic thrust gives Δv ≈ 2.6 m/s/day in drag-free conditions; scales ~1/r². NASA Technical Reports Server


Control concepts mirror flight heritage: LightSail 2’s twice-per-orbit trim in LEO and IKAROS’s spin-stabilized ops with reflectivity-control devices. MDPI+1ScienceDirect


ACS3 deployment lessons referenced for imaging/geometry checks and composite-boom behavior. NASA+1


Mass/area budget (CSV) includes a conservative 25 g/m² sail-film assumption aligned with NASA sail studies. NASA Technical Reports Server


P9 — Ops Playbook, Safety Cases & Checklists
Hazard gates for deployment, CRUISE-Φ (photon mode), and the feature-flagged plasma-magnet experiment (kept experimental due to no on-orbit demos). niac.usra.edu


Disturbance tests use typical near-Earth solar-wind dynamic pressure ~1–3 nPa with tails to higher values. Frontiers


P10 — Canary & Rollout
Progressive enablement: short-arc → extended-arc CRUISE-Φ, then bounded PM coil pulses with auto-reverts on torque/thermal/EMI alarms. (ACS3/LightSail heritage informs the thresholds and imagery expectations.) NASAMDPI

What’s in the deep-space upgrade
Design_Specs/Helios-Arc_PM-Φ_Sail_DeepSpace.md — architecture for 5–30+ AU with RPS power (MMRTG baseline; eMMRTG option), reflective Φ-sail as the primary thrust source, and plasma-magnet kept as a bounded experiment. Solar-photon and solar-wind thrust both fall roughly as 1/r², so we size area/power and plan for long arcs instead of high instantaneous thrust. NASA Technical Reports ServerA&A


Power/DeepSpace_RPS_Trade.csv — options: MMRTG (~110 W BOL, ~43.6 kg) vs eMMRTG (NASA concept targeting +25% BOL, +50% EOM at same envelope/interfaces). NASANASA Science+1


P11_DeepSpace_Missionization.md — cruise modes, quarterly β-angle retunes, optional inner-heliosphere PM sweeps (<10 AU). (PM remains “supported-with-caveats”—no flight demo yet—per NIAC.) niac.usra.edu


P12_DeepSpace_Ops.md — RPS power/thermal budgeting, spin-stabilized attitude, auto-reverts on EMI/thermal/torque alarms.


Key numbers (reflective sail, conservative optics κ≈1.8)
We sized a notional A = 400 m² sail on an m = 80 kg bus (RPS included). Using the standard 1 AU radiation-pressure constant (~9.08 µN/m², ideal reflector), the analytic, drag-free envelope is:

(Computed and saved in the deep-space spec; Δv scales with 1/r² via solar irradiance.) Wikipedia
Why this works beyond the asteroid belt
Power without sunlight: MMRTG heritage units deliver ~110 W BOL and ~14+ yr operating life (Perseverance/Curiosity class). NASA’s eMMRTG concept targets ~145 W BOL and much higher EOM power with skutterudite couples while keeping MMRTG-like interfaces. NASANASA Technical Reports ServerNASA Science


Environment model: Typical near-Earth solar-wind dynamic pressure ~2–5 nPa; it decreases outward, with the supersonic wind persisting to the termination shock (~84 AU) and the heliopause (~121 AU) where it transitions to interstellar plasma. We treat PM-sail as experimental and photon-sail as the baseline to/through the heliosheath. A&A NASA Jet Propulsion LaboratoryJHU Applied Physics Lab


Plasma-magnet option (bounded): NIAC Phase I/II “Plasma Magnet” studies argue a large effective interaction radius with modest power; still no flight demo → kept behind feature flags and strict auto-reverts. niac.usra.edu+1


Notes & alternatives
AMTEC RPS remains an interesting long-horizon converter (15–40% theoretical efficiency) studied for radioisotope and reactor heat sources; we’ve left it as a future power-conversion option, not MVP. NASA Technical Reports Server+1


Electric sails (E-sails) are another propellantless deep-space option (charged tethers interacting with the solar wind); we cite them for context but do not integrate them here. AIAA JournalScienceDirect
