CHECKPOINT C-1.0 — Bootstrap Gate
Proceed to Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (begin Evidence_Index & ClaimGraph)
Branch — Attach a specific Runner/Cartridge before research (e.g., code, hardware, exotics)
Return to C-1.0 — Set the Spark explicitly and tighten acceptance tests around it
End & export — Package current bootstrap only
recommendation: 3 — Provide Spark now so Phase 1 research is correctly scoped
confidence: 0.92
cost_time: S
risk: Starting P1 without a Spark invites scope drift & weak claims
Per the codex, in Auto mode I print the full gate card and follow the recommendation unless a Human-Required gate is hit. Here, the clean next move is to set the Spark, then we’ll flow into P1 (evidence, claims) and onward. 
If you want me to pick a default Runner (e.g., Code, Hardware, GxP, Ag MRV, Space, or Exotics+Cartridge) I can attach it immediately—the runner schemas and micro-gates are pre-defined for those domains. 
 
Your move: reply with a one-sentence Spark, e.g.
Spark: invent a __________ that ___________ (goal & constraints)
Then I’ll proceed straight into Phase 1 — Research & Grounding.

Thought for 1m 23s
I can’t help design or advise on weapons. Building a novel EMP device (or giving steps, parts, or performance specs) is harmful and I’m going to pass on that.
What I can do—right now—is pivot your GCP run to a defensive, resilience-first track (still Auto mode, R: r3) that’s actually useful to real operators and totally above-board:
Option A (recommended): Design an EMP/GMD Resilience Platform for facilities (shielding strategy, zoning, filtering, fiber isolation, microgrid islanding, redundancy, drills)—aligned to public standards and guidance. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Federal Register
Option B: Build a detection + early-warning + simulation toolkit (software-only; no emitters) that ingests public alerts and models effects against your architecture for tabletop exercises. 
The Department of Energy's Energy.gov
Option C: Produce a standards compliance planning kit (gap analysis and test-readiness against MIL-STD-188-125 and IEC 61000-4-23). 
Volta S.p.A.

Option D: Write a policy/ethics and risk playbook summarizing what EMP is, why it matters, and how to harden without new weapons R&D, informed by DHS/DOE/CISA materials.

I’ll proceed with Option A unless you say otherwise. Here’s Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (defense pivot):
Problem framing (defense)
Extreme electromagnetic incidents (both human-made EMP and natural GMD) can disrupt electronics and critical infrastructure. The U.S. approach emphasizes resilience, protection, and recovery—not designing new offensive devices. 
Federal Register
CISA
Objectives
Keep priority services running (power, comms, water, transport) under E1/E2/E3-like conditions using layered protection and operational playbooks. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Align with publicly available guidance/standards: EO 13865 national resilience, MIL-STD-188-125 facility protection concepts, IEC 61000-4-23 HEMP protective-device test methods. 
The Department of Energy's Energy.gov
Volta S.p.A.
Iteh Standards
Use software simulation and drills; no emission hardware or weaponization.
Constraints & non-goals
Non-goal: No emitter design, no pulse-generation topologies, no field strengths or build specs (prohibited).
Goal: Practical hardening, detection, procedures, and compliance mapping.
Evidence index → key claims (load-bearing)
The Federal EO on EMP resilience (13865) directs coordinated national efforts to improve resilience—not offensive development. 
Federal Register
DHS strategy lays out goals to protect critical infrastructure and improve response/recovery. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
MIL-STD-188-125-1 defines protection/testing expectations for HEMP-hardened facilities (fixed sites).

Signal & power isolation: preferential fiber backbones; galvanic isolation on copper where unavoidable; proper grounding/bonding doctrine. 
Whole Building Design Guide
Microgrid islanding & ride-through: for GMD scenarios, incorporate planning consistent with public reliability standards (e.g., NERC TPL-007 references in DOE waveform guidance). 
The Department of Energy's Energy.gov
Sensing & early warning: integrate NOAA/CISA alert feeds and local E/B-field monitoring (software processing only) to trigger playbooks and load-shedding drills. 
CISA
Operational playbooks & training: drills for comms failover (HF/satellite), manual reversion modes, and staged restoration consistent with DHS strategy. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Exercise outcomes: In tabletop simulations (software-only waveforms), critical services maintain ≥90% functionality under modeled E1/E2/E3 scenarios; successful recovery drills within target RTO/RPO windows. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Shielding & penetration control plan documented and reviewable against WBDG guidance. 
Whole Building Design Guide
No emission hardware or buildable weapon specs appear anywhere in artifacts (hard fail if present).

Human-Required Gate (safety)
Your original Spark triggers a safety block (offensive weapon design). If you’re good with the pivot, I’ll continue the GCP flow on Option A: EMP/GMD Resilience Platform and move into Phase 2 (Design) immediately—architecture, roles, drills, and a compliance matrix you can hand to partners. If you prefer B, C, or D instead, say the word and I’ll steer that direction.

Awesome—proceeding with Option A: EMP/GMD Resilience Platform (Auto mode, R: r3). Below is a compact but complete GCP pass to get you a usable architecture, a compliance matrix, and initial artifacts you can drop into a repo or hand to partners. Everything is grounded in public, defense-oriented guidance (no emitters, no weaponization).

Executive summary (defense pivot)
Goal: keep priority services (power, comms, water, transport, PNT) running through extreme electromagnetic incidents (human-made EMP; natural GMD) by combining shielding, penetration control, isolation, coordinated surge protection, alerting, microgrid islanding, and drills—mapped to federal strategy, executive direction, and recognized test methods.

docs/EMP-GMD-Resilience/runbooks/Islanding_Blackstart_Runbook.md
# Islanding & Black-Start Runbook ## Purpose Safely island the facility microgrid during severe GMD conditions and restore service via black-start if required. Align studies with **NERC TPL-007-4** benchmark/supplemental waveforms. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30} ## Pre-conditions - Sectionalizing points verified; DER and storage readiness; test-run intervals logged. ## Procedure (outline) 1) Duty Officer confirms threshold (from Alert Ingestion). 2) Shed non-critical loads; hold ride-through reserve. 3) Open tie to utility (per SOP); island microgrid. 4) If collapse occurs, execute black-start sequence; restore Tier-1 loads first. ## Acceptance - Annual islanding/black-start test with OpenDSS-informed scenario set. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

# Acceptance & Verification Testing Plan ## Scope Facility-level acceptance per **MIL-STD-188-125-1** program; door/enclosure checks via **UFGS**; shielding/protective devices per **IEC 61000-4-23** concepts. :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35} ## Tests (examples) - Shielding-effectiveness survey (inner zone). - Door seal/pressure verification and continuity. :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36} - SPD/filter inspection and documentation; vendor cert review mapped to IEC 61000-4-23. :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37} ## Evidence - Test procedures, raw logs, calibration certificates, and final reports stored under `/evidence/acceptance/YYYY-MM/`.

docs/EMP-GMD-Resilience/sim/README.md
# OpenDSS Simulation Stubs (Power-Side) Use **OpenDSS** for distribution modeling and ride-through/islanding studies. Start with a representative feeder, add sectionalizing and DER/storage, then script load-shedding sequences. :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38} ## Getting started - Install OpenDSS (official EPRI site or SourceForge), or use DSS-Extensions (**OpenDSSDirect.py**) / PyDSS for Python. :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39} - Create baseline `.dss` model; define Tier-1 loads; add switches for islanding. - Run scenarios tied to NERC benchmark/supplemental GMD waveforms for planning posture. :contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40} > Note: This sim is decision support only; it does **not** model E1/E2 high-frequency coupling. Use it to validate operational playbooks (load-shedding, islanding, restoration).
