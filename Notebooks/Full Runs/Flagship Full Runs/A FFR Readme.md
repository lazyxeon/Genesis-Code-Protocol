## 6) NITRA-SAFE™ — Inline Nitrosamine Risk Guard (Pharma)
**Invention:** **NITRA-SAFE™** process-analytics + capture module for nitrosamines.  
**What it does:** Threads micro-LC/MS (+TEA) monitoring into unit ops, adds resin capture & RTRT decisioning, and ships validation templates to align with GxP and risk controls.

---

## 7) Helios-Arc PM-Φ Sail — No-Resupply Deep-Space Propulsion
**Invention:** **Plasma-Magnet + Photon Sail** hybrid with beamed-power option.  
**What it does:** Uses a plasma-magnet loop for large effective cross-section plus steady photonic thrust; includes a deep-space variant and a threat/constraints map.

---

## 8) POSEIDON-Loop™ — Submarine Air Quality & Endurance
**Invention:** **Closed-loop life-support** architecture for longer dives.  
**What it does:** Couples solid-oxide CO₂ capture, O₂ generation, staged biofilters, moisture/heat management, and fault-tolerant control to extend safe endurance.

---

## 9) APNL-RT Capacitor — Room-Temp High-Density Design
**Invention:** **AFE polymer nanolaminate** with h-BN interlayers (APNL-RT).  
**What it does:** Lays out fabrication steps and SLOs targeting high energy density and fast charge/discharge at ambient temperatures, with manufacturability notes.

---

## 10) LYRA — “Python-Killer” Language & Toolchain
**Invention:** **LYRA** language + runtime with error-guided compiler and LLM-native DX.  
**What it does:** Focuses on dev ergonomics: structured diagnostics, integrated troubleshooting, modern package/FFI story, and compatibility pathways to win adoption.

---

## 11) FHASS — Bakery Bun Slicing & Bagging (Mechanic-Friendly)
**Invention:** Overbuilt, **field-serviceable slicing/bagging line** for bread plants.  
**What it does:** Modular rails/knife assemblies, ruggedized components, safe access, and maintenance-first layouts tailored to AMF-class environments and real-world abuse.

---

## 12) CRISP-PCM™ — Anti-Sog Delivery Container
**Invention:** **Vented + hydrophobic membrane + PCM + desiccant** hot-hold package.  
**What it does:** Keeps fries/pizza crisp by balancing steam release, heat retention (phase-change inserts), and humidity control; ships a 2-week DOE and GTM naming (e.g., “CRISP-PCM™ Lid”).

---

## 13) ProofLine™ — Court-Ready Media Provenance (Legal)
**Invention:** **ProofLine™** FRE 901/902(14)/C2PA-aligned provenance stack.  
**What it does:** Trusted capture → signed attestations → immutable chain-of-custody → verify CLI + courtroom bundles (901 memo, 902(14) materials), plus a policy/test harness.

---

## 14) Civic Accord Stack (CAS) — Chicago Policy Pipeline
**Invention:** **CAS** for consensus mapping + participatory budgeting + public delibs.  
**What it does:** Leverages Quadratic Polling/Polis, PoD proof ledger, open tallies, risk controls (misinfo, Sybil), and partner lanes (Vision Zero/CDOT, CityKey, PB Chicago).
