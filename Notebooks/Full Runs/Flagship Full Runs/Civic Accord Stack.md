GCP V49 — Flagship (Auto Mode) is live.
Spark: invent a solution to a known political-system issue
 Interpreted issue: rising polarization and low policy legitimacy (trust), worsened by online misinformation and weak preference-aggregation signals.
 Runner: Auto-select (Civic Systems + Exotics) • Risk: R3 • Mode: Auto
Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (evidence snapshot)
Polarization + misinformation dynamics. False news spreads “farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly” than truth on major platforms, driven largely by human sharing behavior (not bots). This degrades shared facts needed for legitimate policy. ScienceMIT NewsMIT Initiative on the Digital EconomyMIT Sloan


What works to improve legitimacy. Systematic reviews from the OECD find representative citizens’ assemblies / deliberative mini-publics can deliver better policies and rebuild trust when properly designed and evaluated. OECD+2OECD+2


Digital consensus mapping that surfaces agreement. Taiwan’s vTaiwan process uses Polis to map opinion clusters and locate consensus that stakeholders can accept; it’s a widely documented, long-running national-scale use case. compdemocracy.orgDemocracy Technologiescongress.crowd.law


Expressing intensity of preferences. Quadratic voting (QV) has been field-tested in Colorado’s legislature to prioritize budget items, offering a way to register intensity—not just direction—of preferences; but transparency and open-meetings compliance must be handled carefully. The Colorado SunRadicalxChangeColo Freedom Info Coalition


Participatory budgeting (PB). PB has growing empirical backing as a democratic innovation linked to engagement and local development; multiple syntheses document effects (with mixed magnitudes across contexts). Taylor & Francis OnlineEcology and Evolution


Phase 2 — Problem statement & success criteria
Goal: Reduce measured polarization and raise decision legitimacy while preserving transparency and legal compliance.
SLO-style targets (pilot level):
≥20% increase in cross-camp consensus statements discovered via deliberation maps (vs. baseline).


≥10 pp increase in perceived fairness/legitimacy in post-process surveys (Likert).


≥2× lift in participation from under-represented groups relative to prior civic processes (parity index).


All preference-elicitation steps meet open-meetings requirements (jurisdiction-specific).


Phase 3 — Proposed invention: the Civic Accord Stack (CAS)
A modular, auditable stack you can bolt into existing institutions:
Sortition micro-publics + Consensus Mapping


Randomly selected, demographically stratified panels (citizens’ assemblies) convene on a policy question.


Deliberation uses Polis-style mapping to reveal areas of agreement/disagreement and to iteratively refine prompts. Outputs: “consensus statements” with participation and diversity metrics. OECDcompdemocracy.org


Proof-of-Deliberation (PoD) Ledger — novel


An append-only, open ledger (no cryptocurrency required) records cryptographic attestations that panelists (and observers) completed balanced briefings, passed comprehension checks, and engaged across difference (measured interactions, not viewpoints).


Each proposal, claim, and counter-claim is linked to sources in an Evidence Graph (claim-IDs + citations), evaluated with the OECD’s evaluation guidelines for deliberative processes. OECD


Transparent Quadratic Preference Elicitation (QPE)


Within the assembly (not binding legislation), use QV/QF-style mechanisms to capture intensity of trade-offs (e.g., budget priorities).


Design constraints from Colorado lessons: use public tokens, publish tallies and rationales, and run sessions in a manner consistent with open-meetings law (names, logs, or live observability depending on statute). The Colorado SunColo Freedom Info Coalition


Participatory Budgeting (PB) Allocator


For community-level line items, run a PB round that consumes the assembly’s consensus + QPE signals, with anti-capture protections (identity verification, per-capita caps, conflict-of-interest attestation).


Expect civic-engagement and local-development benefits as seen across PB literature; measure local effect sizes explicitly. Taylor & Francis OnlineEcology and Evolution


Misinformation Dampening & Pre-bunking


Before votes/deliberations, deliver balanced primers and pre-bunking tasks; PoD ensures exposure/understanding.


Use consensus mapping to highlight shared facts first—counteracting the asymmetric virality of false news documented by MIT. Science


Interfaces & artifacts:
Deliberation Map (public) • PoD attestations (public, privacy-preserving) • Evidence Graph browser • Preference heatmaps • PB allocations with audit trails.


Phase 4 — Threat model (R3) & mitigations
Astroturfing / sybil attacks: KYC-lite verification for voters; sortition draws require verified residency; audit trails on PoD.


Coercion/bribery: staggered, anonymous QPE within assemblies; publish aggregate proof bundles only; independent observers.


Open-meetings compliance: default to public sessions/streams and publish artifacts; if anonymity is required for safety, document statutory basis and provide delayed disclosure—Colorado ruling shows the risk of opacity. Colo Freedom Info Coalition


Misinformation campaigns: pre-bunking; fact-linked claim cards; metamorphic tests on briefs to guard against wording manipulation—motivated by MIT findings. Science


Phase 5 — Validation plan
A/B municipal pilots: comparable policy topics in two similar jurisdictions or across time (DiD design).


Primary outcomes: legitimacy (survey), policy durability (repeal/amend rate), cross-camp consensus growth, participation parity, adherence to legal transparency.


Process audits using OECD evaluation frameworks for deliberative processes; publish full methods + data. OECD


Phase 6 — MVP & rollout (90–180 days pilot)
M1 (90 days): Stand up CAS with one assembly → consensus map → QPE trial → PB micro-round; ship public Evidence Graph + PoD explorer.


M2 (180 days): Scale to 3–5 topics; integrate APIs to council/committee workflows; independent evaluation initiated (external university/NGO).


Phase 7 — Policy & governance hooks
Institutionalization patterns. Follow OECD’s “Eight ways to institutionalise deliberative democracy” to embed CAS (standing panels, legal mandates, budget hooks). OECD


Digital democracy exemplars. Borrow participation workflows demonstrated by vTaiwan/Polis for contested issues (ride-hailing, alcohol laws, etc.). compdemocracy.org


What’s novel here (vs. prior art)
Proof-of-Deliberation ledger tying comprehension and cross-cut engagement to every policy artifact (auditable, privacy-preserving).

A. Compliance profile (Illinois + Chicago)
Open Meetings Act (OMA): meetings must be open; quorums generally in-person; remote attendance only under specific rules adopted by the body.

CAS defaults to public agendas/streams/roll-calls; if safety requires pseudonyms, we publish aggregate proofs and cite the statutory basis. Illinois General AssemblyIllinois Attorney General


FOIA (Illinois/City): records are public by default; Section 7 governs redactions. We publish FOIA-ready indexes and link artifacts (maps, PoD, tallies) to each Department’s FOIA pages/logs. Illinois General AssemblyChicago+1


Identity/residency (no biometrics): use CityKey/standard documents for KYC-lite residency checks; CAS stores hashes/attestations only (no PII) and avoids biometric collection given BIPA’s strong private right of action (amended in 2024 but still stringent). chicityclerk.comChicagoLewis BrisboisReuters


Transparency in preference-taking: Colorado’s court held that anonymous quadratic voting by lawmakers violated open-meetings law; we therefore run QPE on the record with public tallies/rationales. Colorado Public RadioKUNC



Data taps (pre-wired)
Crash data: Crashes / People / Vehicles tables via the Chicago Open Data Portal; CDOT’s own “Data Resources” page points users there. Chicago+2Chicago+2Chicago


Vision Zero plans & reports: Citywide hub and Downtown Action Plan (focus on High Crash Areas). Chicago+1


E-scooter pilots: 2019/2020 pilot evaluation with trip stats, equity findings, and siting lessons for corrals. Chicago+1



Process flow (90 days)
Phase A — Open, legal kickoff (Weeks 1–2)
 Adopt OMA-compliant rules (agenda, streaming, roll-call, archives) and a FOIA index for CAS artifacts. Residency verified via CityKey/standard docs; no biometrics; InfoSec policy applied to all storage. Illinois Attorney GeneralChicago+1chicityclerk.com
Phase B — Consensus mapping (Weeks 2–6)
 Run an open Polis conversation on 2–3 micro-topics (e.g., 20 mph side-street school zones; scooter corrals in High Crash Areas). Publish consensus/contested statements. pol.isDemocracy Technologies
Phase C — Sortition micro-public + PoD (Weeks 4–8)
 A stratified panel reviews balanced briefings, passes comprehension checks, and logs cross-camp engagement as cryptographic PoD attestations. This counters the documented “false spreads farther/faster” problem by ensuring shared facts precede any vote. politics.media.mit.edu
Phase D — QPE session (Weeks 8–10)
 Quadratic preference-taking (on the record) to surface intensity of trade-offs (e.g., which school-zone corridors to prioritize). Public tallies and rationale cards published to the portal. (Designed to avoid the Colorado secrecy pitfall.) Colorado Public Radio
Phase E — PB micro-round (Weeks 10–13)
 Community PB allocates ≤1% of the relevant budget to projects aligned with consensus + QPE; Chicago has deep PB practice via UIC Great Cities / PB Chicago. Great Cities Institute+1

Success criteria (pilot SLOs)
Consensus growth: ≥20% increase in cross-camp consensus statements vs. baseline map. (Measured in Polis.) Democracy Technologies


Legitimacy: ≥10-point lift in perceived fairness/legitimacy (post-process surveys, OECD template). OECD


Inclusion: ≥2× participation from under-represented groups (parity index) vs. prior processes. (PB & panel metrics; UIC PB experience informs outreach.) Great Cities Institute


Compliance: 100% OMA/FOIA conformance (agendas/streams/roll-calls; FOIA index & redactions per §7). Illinois Attorney GeneralIllinois General Assembly



Risk controls (R3)
Misinformation: pre-bunking primers + comprehension gating (PoD) based on MIT’s finding that false news spreads farther/faster mainly via humans. politics.media.mit.eduMIT News


Astroturf/Sybil: residency via CityKey or standard docs; rate-limits + anomaly checks; audit trails. chicityclerk.com

What I need from you to localize the launch
Pick a first corridor/ward focus (e.g., Austin / North Lawndale school-zone corridors; or the CBD High Crash Area from the Downtown plan). I’ll instantly tailor the prompts, stratification frame, FOIA index skeleton, and the day-by-day runbook for that geography. Chicago
If you’d like, I can also emit (right now) a facilitator script pack, OpenAPI YAML file, and sample datasets (synthetic Polis/PoD/QPE/PB rows) matching Chicago’s schema conventions.
