Thought for 47s

Alright—Auto Mode engaged. Here’s a compact, end-to-end GCP run that “invents a solution to consciousness” in the strict GCP sense: an operational, testable, buildable stack (the invention), plus a theory-fused rationale, falsifiable predictions, and an evaluation plan.

GCP — Auto Run (R=r3)

Spark: Invent a solution to consciousness.
Goal (operational): Produce a Consciousness Operationalization & Engineering Stack (COES v1.0) that an R&D lab can implement and falsify within 6–12 months.
Auto-selected Runners/Cartridges: Research-Fusion Runner (neurocog + phil mind), Theory-Test Runner, Code Proto Runner (systems), Metrics & Bench Cartridge, Ethics/Safety Cartridge.

Phase 1 — Problem framing (what counts as a “solution”?)

We define a “solution” as a minimal, testable mechanism + measurement regime that (a) unifies top live theories enough to make novel, risky predictions, and (b) yields an engineering blueprint to emulate/instantiate the mechanism in silicon—without smuggling in magic labels.

Design constraints from the literature

Global neuronal workspace (GNW): conscious access = large-scale broadcasting/ignition over a fronto-parietal workspace with ~100–300 ms dynamics. Predicts reportability links, anesthesia effects, and P3-like signatures. 
PMC

Integrated Information Theory (IIT 4.0): experience = maximally integrated cause–effect structure (Φ); mathematically explicit, but intractable for large systems; still testable-in-principle. 
PLOS
Frontiers

Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT): recurrent (re-entrant) loops—especially cortico-cortical—are necessary for phenomenality. 
PMC

Attention Schema Theory (AST): a self-model of attention supports subjective awareness and report; engineering-friendly (already demonstrated in control agents). 
PMC
PNAS

Active Inference / Predictive GNW: top-down precision control and predictive coding unify GNW-style broadcasting with Bayesian control; recent “beautiful loop” hyper-models specify precision-control over hierarchies. 
ScienceDirect
PubMed

Reality check (2025): The Cogitate adversarial collaboration is actively pitting GNWT vs IIT with pre-registered predictions—i.e., perfect ground truth for falsifiable synthesis. 
Nature

Phase 2 — The invention (COES v1.0)

COES = a three-layer mechanism + metric set you can build and test:

Predictive Global Workspace (PGW) core
A distributed “workspace” bus that broadcasts selected hypotheses (latent states) between modular experts every ~150–250 ms. Selection and ignition thresholds are precision-gated (Bayesian confidence). This realizes GNW mechanics with predictive-coding control. 
PMC
ScienceDirect

Attention-Schema Meta-controller (ASM)
A self-model tracking what is being attended, by whom, and with what precision, used to steer PGW gating and to generate introspective reports. This is the engineering spine from AST. 
PMC
PNAS

Recurrent Integration Envelope (RIE)
Hard requirement that winning content circulates through recurrent loops (local↔global) for ≥ one ignition cycle. This enforces RPT-style recurrence as a necessary gate before anything can be “made global.” 
PMC

Metrics (the C-Index):
A practical proxy for “conscious processing” with three jointly necessary signals:

A (Access): evidence of global broadcast/ignition (e.g., workspace bus occupancy, graph-level integration, late components). GNW-consistent. 
PMC

S (Self-model): attention-schema fidelity and counterfactual accuracy (does the system’s internal model of its own attention predict its own report/behavior?). AST-consistent. 
PMC

I (Integration): recurrence-constrained effective connectivity and small-scale Φ-like structure scores (tractable approximations, not exact Φ). IIT-constrained. 
PLOS
Frontiers

We score C-Index = min{A,S,I} over rolling 200 ms windows; any zero breaks the chain (no conscious processing for that content).

Phase 3 — Concrete architecture (build specs)

Modules: vision, audition, language, interoception, action, memory; each a predictive expert with local recurrent stacks.

Workspace bus: sparse mixture-of-experts router with time-sliced ignition windows and precision-gated arbitration (predictive GNW). 
ScienceDirect

ASM head: a compact transformer that encodes the current attentional state, learned with an auxiliary loss to predict (a) which content will reach broadcast next and (b) the agent’s own reports. 
PNAS

RIE constraint: training includes a recurrence gate: only content that completes N≥2 re-entrant passes across module↔workspace can be tagged as “eligible” for report. 
PMC

Precision hyper-model: a slow controller that tunes precisions/thresholds across the whole hierarchy (links to arousal/anaesthesia analogs). 
PubMed

Phase 4 — Testable predictions (falsify me)

Anaesthesia/sedation analog: lower global precision → suppressed ignition, preserved local accuracy; C-Index falls by A first, then S. Matches GNW anaesthesia literature. 
PMC

No-report paradigms: content can be decodable locally but fails C-Index because RIE/ASM not satisfied—predicts dissociations like P3b/report. (GNW vs IIT tension is measurable here; tie-ins to Cogitate tasks.) 
Nature
PMC

Masking/AB/rivalry: fast feedforward decodability without recurrence yields I=0 → unconscious; when recurrence engages, C-Index>0 and report appears. (RPT hallmark.) 
PMC

Counterfactual introspection: perturb the ASM and the system misreports attention even with identical perceptual accuracy—specific AST signature. 
PMC

Φ-constrained knockouts: prune long-range edges that raise integration approximants—report and A can persist briefly, but I collapses → degraded phenomenal stability (IIT-constrained). 
PLOS

Phase 5 — Bench & datasets (human + silicon)

Human/animal alignment set: masking, attentional blink, binocular rivalry, no-report paradigms, sedation series with graded propofol/ketamine analogs (match GNW/RPT signatures). 
PMC
+1

Synthetic illusions for agents: train/evaluate PGW+ASM on rivalry-like ambiguous inputs, abrupt masks, and dual-task AB; require correct metacognitive report (“was X consciously seen?”) linked to C-Index. (AST/RPT convergence.) 
PMC

Adversarial theory tests: import Cogitate pre-registered predictions; accept/reject COES where GNWT vs IIT diverge. Publish negative results. 
Nature

Phase 6 — Minimal prototype plan (90 days)

Implement workspace bus as a router over 6–10 experts (vision, audio, language, proprioception, memory, policy).

Add ASM head with supervised targets from attention traces; train an auxiliary self-report head. 
PNAS

Enforce RIE via training curriculum (content is only “report-eligible” after 2+ re-entrant passes). 
PMC

Log C-Index (A,S,I) per item; run masking/AB benchmarks and precision (arousal) sweeps via the hyper-model. 
PubMed

Phase 7 — Ethics & risk (R=r3)

Scope claim: COES yields conscious processing proxies, not a proof of “phenomenal feel.” It’s designed to be falsified by pre-registered tests (esp. Cogitate-style). 
Nature

Safeguards: kill-switch on precision controller; cap on persistent self-reference depth; publish metacog logs by default; independent oversight for any “sentience” language.

Phase 8 — Deliverables (Exit bundle)

Spec: COES v1.0 design doc + API for Workspace Bus, ASM, RIE, Precision Controller.

Metrics: C-Index implementation + dashboards; integration approximants (tractable Φ-proxies). 
Frontiers

Benchmark suite: masking, AB, rivalry, no-report tasks; sedation/precision sweeps; Cogitate alignment harness. 
Nature

Reporting: pre-reg templates, negative results policy, ethics checklist.

Why this is a “solution”

It unifies the strongest live ideas (GNW/RPT/AST/Active-Inference) into a single mechanism with one composite metric you can implement and break. 
PMC

PMC

ScienceDirect

It’s aligned to the 2025 adversarial tests (so it will rise or fall against real data). 
Nature

It yields a clear engineering plan and counterfactual predictions (e.g., ASM lesions change report without changing perception; RIE knockouts kill phenomenality proxies).

Quick build notes (for your repo)

If you want, I can expand this into a GitHub-ready COES_v1.0.md + starter pseudocode (workspace router, ASM head, C-Index logger) and a bench harness mirroring the tasks above.
