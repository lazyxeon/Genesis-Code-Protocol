Alright—booting up GCP V49 Flagship and laying down the Phase −1 scaffold in Auto mode with full gate cards and previews. I’m emitting the bootstrap + core Phase −1 artifacts inline so you can drop in a Spark and go. (This follows the V49 bootstrap that begins at Phase −1 and uses a RUN CONFIG block , and the Phase −1 deliverables list for prompts, policies, invariants, transforms, acceptance tests, SLO seeds, and observability plan . Gate behavior and the checkpoint UX come from the Master Runners Codex global execution contract .)

You’re good to drop in a Spark now (e.g., “Spark: invent X”), and—if you’d like—name a runner (Code / Hardware / GxP / MRV / Deep-Sea / Space, etc.). The runner kickoffs and micro-gates live in the Master Runners Codex; I’ll auto-instantiate their agent graphs, policies, and ledgers once selected (see Code runner kickoff & components for a taste ). All of this stays within the V49 rubric (policy-as-code, observability, novelty/SOTA, rehydration export) .
Say the word—what’s our Spark?
 (We’ll immediately continue to Phase 1 with evidence indexing and claim graphing once you set it.)

Thought for 1m 5s
Awesome—spinning up GCP V49 (Flagship) in Full Manual with Runner = Exotics and Cartridge = Legal, Risk = r3. I’ll keep the classic gate cadence: you get options at each checkpoint, with my recommendation noted.
Phase 1 — Research & Grounding (manual)
Candidate “known legal issue” targets (pick one to specialize)
Admissibility & authentication of digital media in the deepfake era (provenance, chain-of-custody, courtroom verification). Strong cross-domain fit for Exotics (crypto, TEEs, transparency logs) and clear legal hooks under FRE 901/902(14). Legal Information Institute+1


AI-generated content disclosure & labeling compliance (enterprise policy + tooling), mapping to EU AI Act transparency obligations and US policy signals. Artificial Intelligence ActFederal Register


E-discovery authentication of web/social media evidence (automated 902(14) workflows + expert certifications). Robins Kaplanblog.page-vault.com


My recommendation: #1 (deepfake-era media authentication). It’s high-impact, technically rich for Exotics, and has concrete courtroom standards to design against (FRE 901 general authentication; 902(14) self-authenticating data from reliable processes). Legal Information Institute+1

Evidence snapshot for Target #1 (to ground the design)
Legal baseline.
 • FRE 901(a): Proponent must show evidence “is what it is claimed to be.” Examples include witness with knowledge, distinctive characteristics, etc. Legal Information Institute
 • FRE 902(14): Allows self-authentication of data produced by an electronic process or system if certified by a qualified person—crucial for provenance pipelines. Legal Information Institute
 • Courts scrutinize online/digital exhibits; failing to authenticate can sink evidence (e.g., United States v. Vayner). Quimbee


Standards & ecosystem.
 • C2PA is the leading open standard for content provenance and tamper-evident “Content Credentials.” It’s an industry coalition effort (Adobe, Microsoft, OpenAI et al.). C2PA+1OpenAI
 • NIST is actively driving guidance on synthetic content risk and AI risk management (AI RMF profile for GenAI; synthetic content drafts). NIST PublicationsNIST
 • Policy signals. The White House EO 14110 directed agencies/NIST toward safe, trustworthy AI, including watermarking/provenance efforts. Federal Register


Hardware adoption.
 • Cameras are beginning to ship with built-in Content Credentials (e.g., Leica M11-P, and 2025 follow-ons), proving feasibility for in-camera cryptographic signing. Leica CameraContent Authenticity Initiative



Phase 2 — Design Thesis (manual)
Invention: ProofLine™ — a court-ready provenance & authentication stack for digital media
Goal
Make it easy for courts to admit trustworthy media and hard for adversaries to spoof it, by aligning a cryptographic capture → seal → transport → verify pipeline with FRE 901/902(14) requirements and emerging C2PA/NIST guidance. Legal Information Institute+1C2PANIST Publications
Core components (Exotics runner style)
Trusted Capture


Device attestation (TEE-backed): device signs per-frame digests + capture context (time, sensor, lens, GPS optional) into a C2PA Manifest at the point of capture. Where cameras/phones lack native C2PA, a ProofLine App performs a provable “first-capture” seal with hardware keystore keys. C2PA


Live-scene challenge (optional): rapid light/ultrasound micro-pattern challenge to defeat screen re-capture deepfakes (Exotics twist).


Cryptographic Sealing & Transparency


Each clip/image forms a Merkle tree of chunk hashes; the root is embedded into the C2PA Manifest and logged to a public, append-only transparency log (certificate-transparency-style).


Dual logs (jurisdictional redundancy) plus periodic anchoring to a public chain are supported (policy-tunable).


Chain-of-Custody Ledger


Every transfer (creator → newsroom → investigator → prosecutor/defense) issues a W3C Verifiable Credential snapshot (holder, time, manifest hash, purpose). The ledger exports an audit file for court.


Access-controlled redactions generate a new manifest lineage with cryptographic diffs retained.


Verifier & Court Pack


One-click 902(14) Certification Pack:
 a) the system description (process reliability),
 b) method validation results (deterministic hashing, log proofs, negative controls), and
 c) the expert declaration template.


The FRE 901 narrative (identity, capture conditions, distinctive characteristics) is auto-drafted to pair with 902(14).


Red-Team Guardrails


Adversary suite simulates attacks: metadata stripping, frame splices, model-based enhancement indistinguishable from capture, screen re-shoots, timing skew, GPS spoof.


Metamorphic tests (invariance under unit changes; robustness to benign reorder/encodes) to show reliability—ties back to courtroom reliability factors. (We’ll wire these into acceptance tests below.)


Policy Profiles


EU AI Act profile: auto-label synthetic/mixed content (deepfake marking) + provenance retention policies. Artificial Intelligence Act


US profile: emphasize NIST AI RMF + EO 14110 alignment in the certification narrative. NIST PublicationsFederal Register



Phase 3 — Cartridge: Legal (outputs you can file/use)
A) FRE 902(14) Certification Template (excerpt)
Certification of Records Generated by an Electronic Process or System
 I, [Name], [Title, Organization], certify that the attached records were generated by ProofLine™, an electronic process that produces an accurate result, as shown by: (1) a reliable, documented hashing and logging method; (2) validation tests run on [date]; and (3) a verification that the C2PA Manifest root hash and transparency-log inclusion proof match the media presented.
(This aligns with the rule’s allowance for self-authenticating data produced by a reliable electronic process.) Legal Information Institute
B) FRE 901 Authentication Memo (skeleton)
Issue: Whether exhibit X is what it purports to be (unaltered capture from [device/person]).


Facts: Capture context (device attestation), Content Credentials report, chain-of-custody ledger, log inclusion proof.


Law: FRE 901(a) and exemplary methods (witness with knowledge; distinctive characteristics), supplemented by 902(14) certification. Legal Information Institute


Application: Map each ProofLine artifact to a 901 method; attach the 902(14) Certification Pack.


Conclusion: Admit under 901; accept self-authentication under 902(14).


C) Checklist for Counsel
Obtain Content Credentials report (C2PA). C2PA


Export transparency-log proofs + chain-of-custody VC ledger.


Generate 902(14) Certification Pack; identify qualified certifier. Legal Information Institute


Prepare 901 witness (& distinctive characteristics narrative). Legal Information Institute


Run adversarial scans and attach method validation appendix (NIST profile). NIST Publications



Acceptance Tests (deterministic + metamorphic)
AT-01 (Integrity): For a given media file, the verifier reproduces the exact C2PA Manifest root; inclusion proof validates against the public log (deterministic pass/fail). C2PA


AT-02 (902(14) pack): Given verified proofs, the system emits a complete Certification Pack with method description, validation results, and expert declaration draft tied to the file’s SHA-256 (deterministic). Legal Information Institute


AT-03 (901 narrative): The system produces a 901 authentication memo mapping facts to recognized methods (deterministic structure). Legal Information Institute


MT-01 (Unit invariance): Re-encode (e.g., bitrate change) without altering pixel data → provenance remains valid.


MT-02 (Reorder robustness): Benign container stream reorder ≤ r% → manifest verification still passes (or cleanly fails with reason).


AB-01 (Tamper): Byte-level splice invalidates hash/manifest and is flagged with exact offset range.


AB-02 (Metadata strip): Missing Content Credentials → downgrade to non-attested path; tool generates risk memo instead of certification.


AB-03 (Screen re-capture): Live-scene challenge failure elevates risk score; requires human expert testimony rather than 902(14) shortcut.



Threat Model (r3) & Mitigations
Metadata erasure / re-encodes: Lock on hash lineage + transparency log; if Content Credentials missing, system refuses 902(14) and falls back to 901 with enhanced scrutiny. C2PA


Vendor trust / key compromise: Rotate device keys; require transparency-logged key attestations; maintain revocation lists; secondary independent log.


Synthetic enhancement ambiguity: Declare enhancement provenance (e.g., denoise) as separate transforms within the C2PA Manifest; courts see full edit history. C2PA


Policy divergence (US/EU): Toggle policy profiles (EU deepfake labels; US RMF framing) so counsel can meet regional expectations. Artificial Intelligence ActNIST Publications



CHECKPOINT C-2.0 (manual)
Choose how to proceed:
Lock in Target #1 (deepfake-era media authentication) and move to Phase 4 — Technical Spec & Proto Plan (APIs, manifest schema, verification CLI, cert pack generator, red-team suite). [Recommended]


Switch to Target #2 (AI content labeling compliance) or #3 (e-discovery social/web evidence) and re-ground.


Revise acceptance tests / threat model before proceeding.


(Say “Option 1/2/3.” I’ll continue immediately with the next phase.)

The 902(14) certificate workflow pairs a qualified person’s declaration with deterministic verification outputs; this is exactly what the rule contemplates (self-authentication by certification). Legal Information Institutejudicature.duke.eduFederal Judicial Center


5) Legal cartridge outputs (ready-to-file templates)
5.1 FRE 902(14) Certification (fill-in)
I, [Name], [Title], certify under Rule 902(14) that the attached record is an accurate copy verified by ProofLine as follows: (1) hash matching of the proffered item to the C2PA Manifest root; (2) verification that the capture claim signature was valid at the time of signing and not revoked; (3) inclusion proofs showing the transparency-log accepted the entry on [date]; and (4) method validation tests run on [date], documented in Appendix A.
(Note: 902(14) addresses authentication only; hearsay exceptions must be satisfied separately.) Legal Information Institute
5.2 FRE 901 Authentication Memo (skeleton)
Issue: Whether Exhibit X “is what it purports to be.”


Law: FRE 901(a) + illustrative methods (witness w/ knowledge; distinctive characteristics). Legal Information Institute


Application: Map Content Credentials, signer identity, and custody receipts to 901 methods; attach 902(14) certification.


Note: Contrast with negative cases (e.g., Vayner stressing proper authentication of online evidence). CourtListener


6) Threat model (r3) & mitigations
Metadata stripping / re-encode → C2PA claim + hash lineage fails closed; Verifier emits risk memo (no 902(14) path). C2PA


Screen re-capture deepfakes → optional live-scene challenge at capture; absence elevates risk to 901-only path.


Compromised keys → transparency-logged key lifecycle, CRLs, revocation proofs; dual logs.


Policy drift → switchable EU/US profiles; EU label enforcement aligns with AI Act Article 50; US RMF evidence tables for provenance/traceability. Artificial Intelligence ActEuropean ParliamentNIST Publications


Adoption risk → design Verifier to accept both native-C2PA and ProofLine first-capture seals; market reality today is mixed adoption across devices/platforms. The Verge


7) Acceptance tests (deterministic, metamorphic, abuse)
AT-01 Integrity: recompute digests → equals manifest root; inclusion proof verifies against log. (Deterministic.) C2PA


AT-02 Certification: given valid proofs, emit a fully-populated 902(14) pack (method, validation, declaration). (Deterministic.) Legal Information Institute


AT-03 901 Memo: produce structured 901 mapping with cited facts. (Deterministic.) Legal Information Institute


MT-01 Unit invariance: benign re-encode (bitrate/container) → provenance remains valid or fails with precise reason.


AB-01 Splice detection: byte-range tamper triggers manifest/hash mismatch and exact offsets in report.


AB-02 Missing credentials: downgrade to non-attested path + “no 902(14)” warning.


8) Observability & audit
Spans: capture.sign, verify.hash, verify.claim, log.inclusion, courtpack.render


Metrics: provenance_pass_rate, false-accept_rate, equivocation_alerts


Logs: gate decisions + rationale codes (to satisfy courtroom “reliable process” demonstrations under 902(14)). Legal Information Institute


9) MVP build plan (8–10 engineer-weeks, parallelizable)
Verifier CLI (hashing, claim validation, inclusion proofs) + CourtPack generator.


Transparency Log (Merkle tree, inclusion API).


Mobile Capture SDK (Android first; iOS next) with keystore signing; C2PA manifest writer.


Custody Ledger (VC receipts + viewer).


Policy Profiles (EU/US switch) + Label Enforcer for synthetic media. Artificial Intelligence ActEuropean Parliament



Why this is legally defensible (quick grounding)
FRE 901(a) requires a showing that an item is what it claims to be; our stack couples signer identity, secure time, and a verifiable edit lineage to meet common 901 methods. Legal Information Institute


FRE 902(14) permits self-authentication via certification for records generated by a reliable electronic process—our deterministic hashing + logged proofs + documented validation are designed for that certification. Legal Information Institutejudicature.duke.edu

Why this structure passes courtroom muster: FRE 902(14) explicitly contemplates self-authentication of data copied from devices/files via a certification by a qualified person, and highlights hash values as a reliable method. Your CourtPack packages a method description + deterministic evidence (hash + inclusion proofs) suitable for certification. Legal Information Institute

Aligned with the C2PA spec’s model for cryptographically verifiable assertions; you’re adding non-standard labels under the existing claims structure (keepers of the spec: C2PA). C2PA+1

B) Capture Integrations — Pilot Plan (Leica / Nikon / Sony / Mobile)
Why pilots first? Courtroom success improves dramatically when the content is born attested (in-camera or at capture) instead of post-hoc wrapped. C2PA/Content Credentials now ship in real products: Leica M11-P (first to ship), Nikon Z6III (firmware adds Content Credentials), and Sony’s Camera Authenticity Solution expanding across Alpha bodies. Leica CameraNikonNikon Hong KongSony | Alpha UniverseDPReviewSony
Pilot checklist (per vendor)
Leica (M11-P and successors)
Confirm C2PA manifest fields Leica emits and accessible export path; document signer cert chain.


Validate ProofLine Verifier against Leica’s claims; capture one real-world chain-of-custody with newsroom handoffs. Leica Camera


Nikon (Z6III firmware)
Verify firmware version with C2PA “Content Credentials” support; test image+video capture under mixed lighting.


Export claims and check log inclusion interoperability; file pilot results. NikonNikon Hong Kong


Sony (Alpha bodies via Camera Authenticity Solution)
Enroll in Sony CAS; test bodies receiving C2PA-compliant signatures and (where available) Camera Verify feature.


Capture newsroom handoff and third-party verification across ProofLine + Sony tools. Sony | Alpha UniverseSony CorporationCineD


Mobile (Android first, iOS next)
Use platform hardware keystore for first-capture seal where native C2PA isn’t available; record secure time source.


App UX includes optional live-scene challenge (flash/ultrasound pattern) to deter screen re-capture.


Platform label propagation (distribution readiness)
Ensure Content Credentials persist and are recognized downstream; demo on TikTok which now auto-labels AIGC via C2PA Content Credentials (great for public-facing provenance stories). Newsroom | TikTokTechCrunchAP News



C) Legal Hardening Pack
1) FRE 902(14) Certification — Full Template (ready to file)
Certification Under Federal Rule of Evidence 902(14)
 I, [Name], [Title/Qualifications], hereby certify that the attached record was authenticated by the following reliable electronic process:
 (1) The proffered item’s SHA-256 hash was computed and matched identically to the C2PA manifest root embedded at capture;
 (2) The capture claim signature was valid at the time of signing and not revoked;
 (3) The item’s manifest root has a valid inclusion proof in the ProofLine Transparency Log, an append-only Merkle log; and
 (4) Method validation tests were executed on [date] with reproducible results documented in Appendix A.
 I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
 Date: _________ Signature: _____________________
 (Rule 902(14) permits self-authentication of data copied from devices/files via certification; Advisory Notes endorse hash-based verification as reliable.) Legal Information Institute
2) FRE 901 Authentication Memo — Exemplar
Issue. Whether Exhibit X “is what it purports to be.” FRE 901(a). Legal Information Institute
 Law. Authentication may be shown via testimony, distinctive characteristics, or process/system that produces an accurate result; 902(14) can supply self-authenticating certification for electronic copies. Legal Information Institute+1
 Facts. Device/camera attestation (C2PA claim), manifest root + inclusion proof, W3C VC chain-of-custody receipts, and operator declaration. C2PAW3C
 Application.
901(b)(1) Witness with knowledge: operator confirms capture context.


901(b)(4) Distinctive characteristics: content, metadata, and custody receipts align.


901(b)(9) Process or system: ProofLine method described and validated; 902(14) certification attached.
 Conclusion. Admit under 901; accept self-authentication under 902(14). Legal Information Institute


3) Admissibility Playbook (quick use in court)
Bring 902(14) early. Serve the certification + CourtPack and seek stipulations to narrow disputes (Advisory Notes emphasize streamlining). Legal Information Institute


Have 901 fallback. If credentials are missing (screenshots, re-encodes), be ready with circumstantial 901 evidence (distinctive traits, corroboration) and a human witness. Vayner is your cautionary tale on unauthenticated social media. CourtListener


Know the case law texture. United States v. Vayner (2d Cir. 2014) (FB page not self-authenticating without proper foundation); United States v. Browne (3d Cir. 2016) (FB chats not business records; authentication requires extrinsic evidence but can be satisfied). Lorraine v. Markel (D. Md. 2007) remains a foundational map for ESI admissibility checklist. QuimbeeTemple Law SchoolEdiscovery Assistant


Policy alignment helps. In close calls, cite NIST GenAI Profile (provenance/traceability) and EO 14110 focus on watermarking/provenance. Judges appreciate standardized process + documentation. NIST PublicationsFederal Register



Acceptance Tests (wired to the scaffold)
AT-01 Integrity: CLI recomputes hash, validates C2PA claim + log inclusion → pass/fail (deterministic). C2PA


AT-02 902(14) pack: CLI emits a complete certification bundle with method description + validation outputs. Legal Information Institute


AT-03 901 memo: Generator fills memo skeleton with capture facts. Legal Information Institute


MT-01 Unit invariance: Benign re-encode/container swap → manifest still verifies or fails with reason.


AB-01 Splice detection: Byte-range tamper triggers mismatch with offsets.


AB-02 No credentials: Downgrade to 901-only path; emit risk memo (no 902(14) shortcut).



Observability seeds (to prove “reliable process”)
Spans: capture.sign, verify.hash, verify.claim, log.inclusion, courtpack.render.


Metrics: provenance_pass_rate, false_accept_rate, equivocation_alerts.


Audit trail: Store gate decisions + rationale codes in an exportable log to attach to 902(14) packs (explains method reliability). Legal Information Institute



CHECKPOINT C-5.0 — your move
Options:
Code gen: Want me to expand the stubs into runnable TypeScript projects (package.json, deps, unit tests, sample fixture media)?


Pilot kickoff: I’ll draft the 2-page pilot briefs and NDAs for Leica/Nikon/Sony + a mobile capture pilot.


Motions: I’ll draft a motion in limine and a sample stipulation invoking 902(14) to streamline authenticity fights.


Say “1”, “2”, or “3” (or “all”), and I’ll drop the deliverables immediately.

B) Pilot Kickoff — Leica / Nikon / Sony / Mobile (plus short NDA)
1) 2-page pilot briefs (condensed)
Leica (M11-P, successors)
Objective: Validate end-to-end in-camera Content Credentials → ProofLine verify → CourtPack.


Scope: 50 photo + 10 short-video captures across light/ISO ranges; export manifests; verify signer chain; produce public demo.


Dependencies: Leica’s Content Credentials output and export tooling. Leica M11-P publicly ships with Content Credentials (C2PA). Leica Camera


Nikon (Z6III w/ Content Credentials firmware)
Objective: Confirm Nikon firmware’s C2PA “Content Credentials” interop with ProofLine.


Scope: Shoot RAW/JPEG/HEIF/MP4; confirm manifest fields; inclusion logs; custody receipts.


Note: Nikon announced Content Credentials firmware development for Z6III. NikonNikon Rumors


Sony (Camera Authenticity Solution; Camera Verify)
Objective: Verify Sony’s in-camera signatures + Camera Verify URLs alongside ProofLine Verifier paths.


Scope: Alpha bodies under Sony CAS; produce newsroom handoff and third-party verification report.


Signal: Sony launched “Camera Verify” (news org sharing URLs; C2PA signatures + depth data). Sony | Alpha Universeauthenticity.sony.net


Mobile (Android first, iOS next)
Objective: First-capture seal using platform keystore + C2PA manifest writer; optional live-scene challenge.


Scope: App POC; compare sealed vs non-sealed captures; show 901-fallback when credentials absent.


Platform propagation
Goal: Downstream recognition & labeling. TikTok auto-labels AIGC using Content Credentials; use it to demonstrate provenance visibility to end-users. Newsroom | TikTokTikTok SupportThe Verge


2) Short Mutual NDA (pilot use)
1. Confidential Info. Non-public product specs, manifests, keys, firmware details, test media, logs, legal documents, and pricing.
 2. Use/Protection. Use only for the pilot; protect with at least reasonable care; no reverse engineering of keys or proprietary signing methods.
 3. Exceptions. Already known; independently developed; or public without breach.
 4. Term. 2 years from last disclosure; court disclosures permitted as required by law with notice.
 5. IP. Each party keeps its IP; C2PA manifests and transparency-log entries relating to test media may be publicly demonstrated by mutual consent.
 6. Export & Compliance. Follow applicable crypto/export laws.
 7. No warranties; limitation of liability.

C) Legal Hardening Pack
1) FRE 902(14) Certification (ready-to-file)
Certification Under Federal Rule of Evidence 902(14)
 I, [Name], [Title/Qualifications], certify that the attached record was authenticated by a reliable electronic process as follows:
 (1) The proffered item’s SHA-256 equals the C2PA manifest root embedded at capture;
 (2) The capture claim signature validated against the signer’s certificate chain;
 (3) The manifest root has a valid inclusion proof in an append-only transparency log; and
 (4) Method-validation tests were executed on [date], with reproducible outputs in Appendix A.
 I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
 (The Advisory Committee Note to 902(14) recognizes hash matching as a reliable method; 902(14) is authentication only and does not satisfy hearsay.) Legal Information Institute
Authority snapshot:
 FRE 901(a) requires showing the item “is what it is claimed to be.” FRE 902(14) allows self-authentication of records generated by a reliable electronic process via certification; the Advisory Note explicitly describes hash equivalence and limits 902(14) to authenticity (not hearsay). Legal Information Institute+1
2) FRE 901 Authentication Memo (exemplar)
Issue: Whether Exhibit X is what it purports to be. FRE 901(a). Legal Information Institute
 Law: Authentication may be shown by witness testimony, distinctive characteristics, or a process/system producing an accurate result; 902(14) permits a certification path for electronic copies. Legal Information Institute+1
 Facts: Device/camera attestation (C2PA claim), manifest root + inclusion proof, W3C VC custody receipts. C2PAW3C
 Application:
901(b)(1) Witness — operator affirms capture context.


901(b)(4) Distinctive characteristics — content + metadata + custody receipts align.


901(b)(9) Process/System — ProofLine method; 902(14) certification attached.
 Conclusion: Admit under 901; accept self-authentication under 902(14).


3) Motion in Limine (admit authenticated media & streamline foundation)
Relief requested. An order deeming Exhibit X authenticated under FRE 902(14) on service of the attached certification and allowing introduction without a sponsoring witness, reserving all other objections.
 Grounds. The record is verified via deterministic hashing matching the C2PA manifest root and logged in an append-only transparency log (Merkle-tree based), a reliable electronic process; Advisory Notes endorse hash-based proof. Legal Information InstituteIETF Datatracker
 Alternative. If the Court declines 902(14), admit under FRE 901 (testimony + distinctive characteristics + reliable process). Legal Information Institute
4) Stipulation re: Authenticity (902(14))
The parties stipulate that Exhibit X is authentic under FRE 902(14) upon exchange of the CourtPack (hash report, C2PA claim verification, inclusion proof, method description). This stipulation does not waive any objection other than authenticity.
5) Admissibility Playbook (quick)
Serve the 902(14) certification + CourtPack early; Advisory Note contemplates avoiding unnecessary witnesses. Legal Information Institute

Next step options (you can pick multiple)
Runbooks & tests — I can expand unit tests for hash/merkle/log, add sample fixtures, and script AT-01/02/03.


Vendor outreach — I can draft the 2-page pilot proposal emails to Leica/Nikon/Sony and a P0 mobile POC brief.


Court demo — I can generate a mock CourtPack ZIP (cert + JSON reports) you can hand to counsel.

All three—delivered. Here’s everything you asked for, ready to use.

1) Court demo (mock CourtPack ZIP)
Download: CourtPack_ProofLine_Mock.zip
 Contents:
 Certification_90214.md (filled), Method_Description.txt, Verification_Report.json, Inclusion_Proof.json, Appendix_A_Validation.md, and a small fixture_media.bin with a real SHA-256 used throughout the pack.


Why this flies legally: FRE 902(14) lets you self-authenticate data copied from devices/files via certification; the Committee Note explicitly cites hash matching and clarifies that 902(14) covers authenticity only, not hearsay. Legal Information Institute

2) Pilot kickoff pack (+ short NDA)

Outreach email mini-templates (copy/paste)
Leica (M11-P)
Subject: Pilot: In-camera Content Credentials → courtroom-ready 902(14)
 Hello {Leica PM},
 We’re piloting an end-to-end provenance flow: M11-P capture (Content Credentials) → third-party verification → a FRE 902(14) CourtPack. We’d like a 2-day joint pilot (50 photos / 10 short videos) to produce a public demo and interop report. Brief attached; NDA included.

Nikon (Z6III)
Subject: Z6III Content Credentials firmware—interop pilot with ProofLine
 Hello {Nikon team},
 Requesting a short interop pilot for the Z6III firmware that adds Content Credentials (C2PA). Goal: capture, export manifest, verify signer chain and (where possible) log inclusion, then generate a courtroom pack.
 — {You}
Sony (CAS / Camera Verify)
Subject: CAS + Camera Verify → newsroom-shareable authenticity + third-party verification
 Hello {Sony CAS},
 We’d like to validate Sony CAS signatures and Camera Verify URLs alongside our verifier, then publish a newsroom handoff demo with independent verification. One-pager + NDA attached.
 — {You}
Mobile (Android first)
Subject: First-capture sealing POC (Android Keystore + C2PA manifest)
 Hello {Partner},
 Proposal: a 2-week Android POC using hardware keystore for first-capture seal, a basic C2PA manifest writer, and live-scene challenge option. We’ll compare sealed vs non-sealed captures and output 902(14) packs.
