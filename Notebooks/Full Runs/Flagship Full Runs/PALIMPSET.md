CHECKPOINT C−1.0 — Prompt Surface & Acceptance Harness
Proceed to Phase 1 — Research & Grounding — once Spark is provided and RUN_CONFIG updated


Branch to Runner Selection — auto-select a domain runner based on Spark and risk profile


Return to C−1.0 — Rework acceptance harness thresholds or policies if they’ll differ by domain


End & export — Package Phase −1 bootstrap (for reuse across runs)


Recommendation: 2 — Pre-select runner immediately after Spark is set to seed domain templates; confidence 0.85; cost_time S
 Risk: Advancing without a Spark leads to scope creep and invalid evidence indexing.
When you’re ready, drop your Spark (and optional runner choice) and I’ll continue from Phase 1 automatically, wiring in the appropriate runner/cartridges and emitting the next artifacts. (Spec refs again: , )

Problem statement → objectives (Phase 1)
Dense canopy, subtle micro-relief, soil moisture variability, and ethical redaction needs make automated, defensible archaeological prospection hard. We need a system that (a) pierces canopy/soil where possible, (b) enhances micro-topography for human + ML interpretation, (c) fuses multiple sensors over time, and (d) publishes responsibly (anti-looting). Key visualization baselines include Local Relief Model (LRM), Sky-View Factor (SVF), and Openness, which consistently outperform naive hillshade for small features. Wiley Online LibraryMDPI+1

Invention: PALIMPSEST
Physics-Aware LiDAR–SAR–GPR Fusion for Archaeology
What it is
A modular pipeline + toolkit that ingests airborne/UAV LiDAR, spaceborne SAR (L- and P-band), and GPR array cubes; auto-renders best-in-class relief visualizations; runs a multi-task detector/segmenter trained with synthetic terrain and open ALS datasets; and enforces tiered redaction aligned with Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) & anti-looting norms.
1) Sensing & data sources
LiDAR (UAV/airborne) for high-res DTMs; optional single-photon/Geiger-mode acquisition for efficiency (trade-off: higher noise, moderate canopy penetration vs linear-mode). MDPIisprs-annals.copernicus.org


Space LiDAR context (GEDI on ISS; ICESat-2/ATLAS photon-counting) to characterize canopy & help plan acquisitions/leaf-off windows. GEDIPMCNational Snow and Ice Data Center


L-band SAR (e.g., NISAR, ALOS-2) for all-weather mapping, moderate vegetation penetration, paleo-landscape and moisture cues; P-band (ESA BIOMASS) for deeper canopy transparency context at coarser res. Jet Propulsion LaboratorySETI InstituteTaylor & Francis OnlineMDPIPhys.org


GPR multi-channel arrays for site-scale 3D subsurface validation where soil permits; proven at Stonehenge-scale mapping. OpenEdition JournalsUniversität Wien


2) Rendering & feature cues (“RVT+”)
Automated batch generation and objective selection of DTMs using SVF, Openness (±), multi-illuminated hillshade, and LRM, with a CV-based benchmark chooser (e.g., Guyot et al.). Output is a “relief stack” standardized for ML + experts. MDPI+1Wiley Online LibraryScienceDirect
3) ML core
Pretraining: self-supervised contrastive learning on relief stacks and SAR backscatter grids.


Detectors: CNN/ViT hybrid trained on open datasets (e.g., Archaeoscape—888 km², 31k labels) + synthetic scenes of mounds/ditches/field systems; recent reviews show strong results of CNNs on ALS derivatives. archaeoscape.aiarXivMDPI


Physics-aware fusion: late fusion heads respect sensor physics (incidence, wavelength, moisture), reducing spurious alignments.


4) Uncertainty, claims, & audits
Every auto-detection ships with evidence cards (modalities used, thresholds, confusion risks) and counterfactual checks (paraphrase/units invariance; multi-illumination stability).
5) Ethics & safeguarding
Tiered map outputs: public (coarse, fuzzed ≥1 km for sensitive features), trusted-researcher (exact, gated).


Governance: embed anti-looting guidance and community co-stewardship (IDSov/CARE). Literature warns of looting risks with high-res LiDAR releases—design errs on protection by default. journal.caa-international.org+1obtlab.climate.columbia.edu

Awesome—dense rainforest it is. Here’s a rainforest-tuned version of the LiDAR/SAR pipeline, plus when (and when not) to bolt on GPR.
Rainforest PALIMPSEST (auto mode, runner auto-select)
1) Sensors & acquisition (what to fly / pull)
Airborne LiDAR (ALS, linear mode; full-waveform if available).
 Target high ground-return rates under closed canopy: small footprints, multi-return, cross-flight lines; run in the dry season to minimize undergrowth and water on leaves. Lower PRF / short pulse widths help resolve weak ground hits in vegetation; full-waveform improves ground detection beneath canopy. MDPI+1ScienceDirect
 Proven rainforest wins: Maya lowlands, Angkor, and the Amazon. Caracol Archaeological ProjectPNASThe Washington Post
 Practical point densities: archaeology can “work” at a few ground pts/m², but dense rainforest benefits from substantially more; follow EAC 2025 guidance and recent reviews when specifying collections and filtering. ZenodoResearchGateMDPI


Space LiDAR & canopy products for planning & QC: use GEDI footprints and ICESat-2 ATL08 canopy/ground metrics to pick driest, more open terra firme ridges for flight blocks and to sanity-check canopy height. GEDI+1National Snow and Ice Data Center


SAR for foliage-penetrating context & change:
 Pull ALOS-2 L-band stacks now; add NISAR L/S-band once your AOI is in its cycle (launched July 30, 2025; open data). L-/P-band penetrate canopies better than C-band and highlight hydrology, earthworks edges, and moisture anomalies; BIOMASS P-band adds forest-structure context.

SAR fusions: L-band backscatter/texture + interferometric coherence masks to spotlight linear features (roads/causeways), ditches, and seasonally wet features otherwise hidden under canopy. MDPI+1


3) Detection & triage
Model-based picks: train on known earthworks (Caracol/Angkor exemplars) and morphometrics (banks, terraces, rectilinear plots); flag anomalies >50 m length or coherent clusters. Caracol Archaeological ProjectPNAS


Risk & ethics gate: mask culturally sensitive areas and suppress exact coordinates in public outputs (follow EAC + CARE/Indigenous data guidance to mitigate looting risk). journal.caa-international.org+1Data Science Journal


4) Ground methods (should we add GPR?)
Short answer: Yes, but tactically. Dense rainforest soils are often wet and clay-rich—high conductivity kills radar penetration and clarity. Use GPR selectively on well-drained sandy ridges, during the driest window, and expect limited depth in clays. Environmental Protection AgencySensors & SoftwareRe Public PolimiUSFS Research & Development
GPR go/no-go (auto triage):
Go if EM induction recon shows low apparent conductivity, recent rainfall < threshold, soils sandy/loamy; deploy 400–200 MHz shielded antennas (and multi-channel arrays only where trails/clearings allow). MDPI+1


Caution/No-go in wet/clayey or highly conductive soils; attenuation is severe. Prefer resistivity/EMI or magnetometry there. MDPICLU-IN


Why the caution? Numerous studies document moisture/clay attenuation and site-specific success—great in dry sand, poor in wet clays common to rainforests. Faculty of ArtsResearchGate
If green-lit, the GPR module (runner auto-select):
Survey design: 0.25–0.5 m line spacing grids over LiDAR/SAR hits; start with 400 MHz, drop to 200 MHz if needed; kinematic GNSS/IMU. geophysical.com


Arrays: Where feasible, multi-channel sleds (e.g., MIRA/Stream-type) for rapid 3D volumes across clear lanes. Guideline GeoMDPI


QC: moisture log, conductivity transects, and repeat lines; reject volumes with ringing/smearing due to coupling or saturated layers. MDPI


Fallbacks: If GPR underperforms, switch to ERT (for ditches/voids) and EMI/magnetometry (for fired surfaces, metal, soil contrasts) under canopy. MDPI


5) Pilot block (10 × 10 km rainforest tile)
Inputs: ALS dry-season block (spec via EAC 2025), ALOS-2 archive; add NISAR L/S as it rolls in. ZenodoNASA Earthdata


Success criteria:
 — ≥0.5 ground pts/m² average in closed canopy; DTM RMSE < 0.20 m vs. ground checks. MDPI
 — ≥80% recall of known test features (ditches/terraces) in RVT stack. MDPI
 — For GPR tiles: coherent reflections at target depths in ≥60% of “Go” cells; otherwise pivot to ERT/EMI. Sensors & Software

Awesome — moving to execution for dense rainforest. Below is a concrete, field-ready plan with specs, decision logic, and acceptance tests. I’m auto-selecting sensors/modes as requested.
Dense-Rainforest Archaeology: LiDAR-First, SAR-Assisted, Targeted GPR
0) Executive choice
Primary: Airborne LiDAR (full-waveform or high-return discrete) for bare-earth DTM + micro-relief. This is the proven unlock in jungles (Angkor; Maya lowlands). PNAS+1National Geographic


Space SAR assist: Use L-band (and where useful, P-band) to map canopy structure, moisture, and stability and to guide where LiDAR and ground teams focus. New NISAR (L+S) is up, and ESA BIOMASS (P-band) launched Apr 29 2025. NASANASA ScienceEuropean Space Agency


On-ground: GPR only where soils are sandy/low-clay and dry (causeways, levees, mounds, ridges). Otherwise prioritize ERT/EMI and targeted test pits; GPR attenuates badly in wet/clayey rainforest soils. ScienceDirectEthernet



1) Pilot Block Brief (Auto-selected baseline)
Area: 10 × 10 km pilot tile (100 km²) representing the densest canopy + a hydrologically varied transect.
Acquisition window: Local dry season, mornings (reduced convection/cloud).
Aircraft & sensor: Crew-ed or large UAV ALS with:
Full-waveform or ≥4 returns per shot discrete.


Narrow beam divergence; scan angle ≤±20° to maximize ground hits under dense canopy. (Forest LiDAR studies show low scan angles + high pulse rate improve ground returns.) IDS Georadar


LiDAR performance targets (commissioning)
Pulse density (NPD): ≥20–30 pulses/m² (flight-line planning), with angle diversity (≥2 opposing directions + 1 cross-strip).


Ground-point density (GPD): aim ≥0.5–1.0 ground pts/m² in rainforest to support a 0.5 m DTM grid (the practical “gold standard” for archaeology).


Overlap: ≥60% sidelap; ≥30% forward overlap; 2 cross-strips per 10 km to check boresight/IMU.


Deliverables
DTM 0.5 m, DSM 0.5 m, CHM; intensity + full waveforms if available.


RVT visualizations (see §2) as 16-bit GeoTIFFs (SVF, positive/negative openness, local relief model, multi-hillshade, VAT blend). Relief Visualization ToolboxWiley Online Library


QC kit: checkpoints, swath overlaps, boresight report, accuracy report per USGS LBS v2.1 / ASPRS. USGSD9 WretASPRS


Acceptance tests (pilot):
Vertical accuracy (open): RMSEz ≤ 10 cm (USGS QL2/ASPRS 10 cm class). D9 Wret


Relative accuracy: inter-swath mean dz ≤ ±5 cm; 95% ≤ ±15 cm. (Project-level conformance to ASPRS/USGS.) ASPRS


Completeness: ≥90% of 25×25 m cells with GPD≥0.5/m²; gaps flagged for re-fly. (Archaeology-driven threshold tied to 0.5 m DTM guidance.)



2) DTM “Reveal” stack (auto-build)

4) GPR module (conditional enable)
Run GPR only when soils are low-clay, well-drained, and access allows grids. Otherwise it’s inefficient/noisy in rainforest. ScienceDirect
When enabled (auto-select)
Arrays: vehicle-towed IDS Stream X (2 m swath) for big flats; hand-pushed MALÅ MIRA HDR/Compact for trails/clearings. IDS GeoradarGuideline Geo+1


Frequencies: dual-band 200–400 MHz (depth 2–3 m, moderate resolution) + a 600–800 MHz add-on over mound tops/compacted surfaces.


Grids: 0.25–0.5 m line spacing; RTK GNSS or total station control.


Deliverables: time-slices at 10–20 cm intervals; 3D cubes; interpreted horizons.


Acceptance: EM noise floor < −95 dBm; penetration to ≥1.5 m with identifiable reflectors in ≥70% of grid; tie-line misfit < ±10 cm.


If soils are too conductive or saturated (common in rainforest clays), switch to ERT transects for ditch/mound contrast and an EMI mapper for broad conductivity texture. ResearchGate

5) Field workflow (10 days, pilot)

Metrics: PR at IoU 0.3 (earthworks are fuzzy); report per-class F1 (mound, platform, ditch, canal).


Note: Recent work shows broadscale CNNs generalize across large areas — but human-in-the-loop is essential. ScienceDirect

10) Risks & mitigations
Canopy too dense ⇒ low ground points → increase angle diversity, slower airspeed, higher NPD; re-fly strips; still expect patchy GPD in the very densest patches (seen at Ceibal). ResearchGate


Weather/cloudbursts → keep short morning windows; SAR fills time-series gaps. NASA


GPR underperforms (clay/wet) → switch to ERT/EMI; keep GPR as opportunistic. ScienceDirect



11) Scale-up criteria (from pilot to full AOI)
Proceed to full coverage when all of these hold:
Accuracy: RMSEz ≤10 cm (open) + relative dz within thresholds. D9 Wret


Completeness: ≥85–90% cells with GPD≥0.5/m² at 0.5 m DTM.


Discovery yield: ≥60% confirmation rate on top-rank candidates.

Perfect—kicking off the rainforest pilot with concrete, copy-pasteable artifacts. I’ve split them into three bundles you can drop straight into your repo.

1) LiDAR Vendor Commissioning Brief (rainforest pilot)
Project: Dense-rainforest archaeological prospection (10×10 km pilot)
 Primary sensor: Airborne LiDAR (ALS), full-waveform preferred; discrete with ≥4 returns acceptable.
 Assist sensors (context & planning): L/S-band SAR (NISAR), L-band archive (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2), and P-band forest-structure context (ESA BIOMASS). Use SAR mainly for hydrology/seasonality and access planning; LiDAR is the primary DTM source. NASAAlaska Satellite Facilityeorc.jaxa.jpEuropean Space Agency
Acquisition window
Season: Local dry season; mornings where possible to reduce convection/cloud/precipitation.


Coverage: 100 km² pilot with ≥60% side-lap and ≥30% forward-overlap; include two cross-strips for boresight.


Flight & sensor settings
Scan angle: ≤ ±20° to maximize ground returns beneath closed canopy.


Pulse density (planning): ≥20–30 pulses/m² nominal; multi-direction look (opposing headings + cross-strip).


Ground-point density (commissioning target): ≥0.5–1.0 ground pts/m², enabling a 0.5 m DTM grid for micro-relief archaeology. (DTM grid is a project requirement; accuracy classes per USGS/ASPRS below.) USGS


Accuracy & quality standards (must-meet)
Vertical accuracy class: USGS 3DEP QL2 (or better): RMSEz ≤ 10 cm (NVA). Report NVA and VVA per USGS LBS 2020 rev. A & ASPRS standards. USGS Data WarehouseASPRS


Relative (swath-to-swath) accuracy: Inter-swath Δz thresholds per USGS LBS Online: localized pass if Δz ≤ 8 cm in overlap; contiguous Δz > 16 cm unacceptable. Provide DZ (delta-Z) orthos. USGS


Quality level summary reference: USGS 3DEP QL table (QL2 ≥2 pts/m², 1 m DEM nominal; we are commissioning higher density for rainforest). USGS


Deliverables
Point cloud: LAS 1.4 PDRF 6/7/8/9/10; overlap/withheld flags correct; calibrated & boresighted. USGS


Rasters: DTM 0.5 m, DSM 0.5 m, CHM, intensity; tiled GeoTIFF (COG preferred).


Reports: Calibration/boresight, absolute & relative accuracy (NVA/VVA; DZ orthos), completeness maps (25×25 m cells with GPD≥0.5/m² flagged).


Metadata: FGDC/ISO compliant; flight logs; GNSS/IMU details; processing lineage.


Acceptance tests (pilot gate)
Vertical accuracy (open): RMSEz ≤ 10 cm (QL2). USGS Data Warehouse


Relative accuracy: Inter-swath Δz localized ≤ 8 cm; no contiguous > 16 cm artifacts; include DZ orthos. USGS


Completeness: ≥90% of 25×25 m cells with GPD≥0.5/m²; gap list for re-fly.


Spec conformance: LAS 1.4 flags, QL class reporting (NVA/VVA), processing per USGS LBS. USGS


Rationale: Jungle archaeology requires bare-earth micro-relief at sub-meter grid spacing; the QL2 accuracy frame is widely adopted and auditable. Case studies (Angkor, Maya, Amazon) show LiDAR reveals extensive engineered landscapes under rainforest canopy. PNASScienceNature

3) GPR “Go/No-Go” Decision Tree (rainforest soils)
Save as /ground/GPR_decision.yaml:
version: 1
purpose: >
  Decide when to deploy GPR in dense rainforest archaeology, where wet/clayey soils often attenuate radar.
inputs:
  - recent_rain_mm_72h
  - soil_texture: [sand, loamy_sand, sandy_loam, loam, silt_loam, clay_loam, silty_clay, clay]
  - apparent_conductivity_class: [low, moderate, high]   # from EMI transect or soil map
  - access: [vehicle_trail, footpath, none]
  - target_depth_m: ~
rules:
  - if: (apparent_conductivity_class == low) and (soil_texture in [sand, loamy_sand, sandy_loam]) and (recent_rain_mm_72h <= 10)
    then:
      decision: GO
      config:
        antennas_mhz: [400, 200]
        line_spacing_m: 0.25-0.5
        array: prefer_vehicle_towed_if access == vehicle_trail else hand_pushed
        deliverables: [time_slices_0p1m, 3d_cube, interpreted_horizons]
  - if: (apparent_conductivity_class == moderate) and (recent_rain_mm_72h <= 20)
    then:
      decision: CAUTION
      notes: try 200 MHz; smaller grids; consider repeat after drying
  - if: (apparent_conductivity_class == high) or (soil_texture in [clay_loam, silty_clay, clay]) or (recent_rain_mm_72h > 20)
    then:
      decision: NO_GO
      alternatives: [ERT_transects, EMI_mapping, magnetometry]
acceptance:
  GO:
    - penetration_depth_m >= 1.5
    - coherent_reflectors_present: true
    - tie_line_misfit_cm <= 10
  CAUTION:
    - review_signal_to_noise and moisture_log
  NO_GO:
    - document_why and schedule_ERT_EMI
notes:
  references: >
    GPR works best in dry, sandy, low-conductivity soils; clay/wet conditions severely limit penetration.
    Use EMI to screen conductivity; schedule during driest windows.

Why this logic: Standard references stress low conductivity + dry sands are suitable; wet/clayey soils cause severe attenuation, common in rainforests. Vendor field guides (Sensoft/GSSI) quantify reduced penetration in clay (~1–1.5 m), supporting cautious, targeted use. SensoftGSSI Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc.+1

Congo-ready plan: LiDAR/SAR (+GPR where it helps) for rainforest archaeology
Here’s a compact, execution-ready version of the stack we designed—now tuned for the Congo Basin (both DRC and Republic of the Congo).
1) When to fly (rainforest seasonality)
Aim for the longer mid-year dry window in the south of the Basin (roughly June–August around Brazzaville/Kinshasa); areas north of the Equator have a stronger Nov–Mar dry phase. Expect a bimodal rainfall regime overall (two wet and two “dry” transitions), and schedule sorties early morning to dodge convective cloud build-ups.


2) Sensor stack (what to collect & why)
Primary: Airborne LiDAR (topographic)


Target ≥10–15 pulses/m²; what matters most is ground returns (aim ≥5–10 ground returns/m² in old-growth). Use multi-angle scan, moderate FOV, and overlap ≥30%. This is the proven playbook for revealing earthworks beneath dense tropical canopies.


Spaceborne context (before/after flights)


NISAR (L+S band SAR) now on-orbit (launched 30 July 2025): 12-day global coverage → moisture-agnostic canopy/soil structure change maps to help triage flight boxes and flag recent disturbance. Open data.


ESA BIOMASS (P-band SAR) launched 29 Apr 2025: deep-canopy structural signals & biomass layers across the Basin; use for background models and masking very dense stands vs. mixed savanna-forest mosaics.


GEDI canopy height + ICESat-2 ATL08 segments: pre-select ridgelines/terraces likely to host features and assess expected LiDAR ground-hit difficulty.


Optional module: GPR (selective, not blanket)


Use 100–200 MHz antennas on targets of interest (roads, mounds, borrow pits) where soils are sandy/low-clay and dry; avoid highly weathered ferralsols/acrisols in wet conditions (high electrical conductivity → heavy attenuation). Make the call in the field after quick EM conductivity + ring-down tests.


3) Country-specific compliance (fly legal, fly once)
DRC (Congo-Kinshasa)


Civil Aviation: Autorité de l’Aviation Civile (AAC/RDC) oversees overflight/landing and Aéronefs Télépilotés (UAS) authorizations; use their channels for manned LiDAR flights and any drone work.


Archaeology permits: research authorizations are processed via the Institut des Musées Nationaux du Congo with final approval by the Ministry (Culture/Arts); build this into lead time. Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute


Protected Areas: if any AOI overlaps national parks (Virunga/Salonga/Kahuzi-Biega, etc.), engage ICCN for research access/escorts.


Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville)


Civil Aviation: ANAC is the authority; obtain overflight/landing and any UAS authorizations there.


Protected Areas: permits in parks are coordinated with ACFAP (under MEFDD).


Tip: cross-border airboxes happen here—don’t plan single-sortie swaths that straddle both countries without both CAAs’ paperwork in hand.
4) Congo-tuned acquisition settings
Block design: 5×5 km tiles, 60–70% sidelap along suspect alignments (river levees/terraces/bais).


Altitude & FOV: keep to 800–1200 m AGL with 20–30° scan; trade altitude for pulse density if cloud ceilings force lower flight levels.


Imagery add-ons: RGB + NIR (leaf-on) for canopy context; green bathy LiDAR only if fluvial archaeology in clear water is a priority.


Field QA: place low-height checkerboards at clearings; GNSS base + PPP; collect soil cores at test pits (moisture & grain size) to drive the GPR go/no-go.


5) Deliverables & CRS
DTM 0.5 m (hydro-conditioned), DSM, intensity, ground/non-ground point clouds; plus multi-illumination hillshades (315°, 45°, 225°, 135°), local relief, sky-view, and slope/curvature stacks for feature detection.


CRS: deliver in WGS84 / UTM for the AOI and, for DRC projects, also in RGRDC 2005 / Congo TM to match national mapping.


6) Where GPR helps here (decision rule)
Run GPR where pre-screen (GEDI/ICESat-2 + LiDAR quicklooks + soil augers) says sandy/alluvial and dry—e.g., levees, relict channels, margins of bais (natural clearings common in the region). Skip in persistently wet, clay-rich laterites.


7) Ethics, safety, and data handling
Mask sensitive loci (blur/withhold exact coordinates) in any public output to reduce looting risk; share precise geometries only with vetted counterparts. This practice follows norms developed after high-profile tropical LiDAR surveys.


Community protocols: brief local administrators and customary authorities; abide by park-level research rules (ICCN/ACFAP).


8) Quick ops plan (auto-runner, minimal touch)
Desk triage (remote): pull NISAR/BIOMASS recent passes + GEDI/ATL08; draw 2–3 candidate boxes per AOI.


Permits in parallel: lodge CAA overflight/landing + archaeology + PA permits (if needed). Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute


Dry-season sortie: manned LiDAR first; drone only for gap-fills/clearings.


Rapid QC + GPR spot-checks on flagged features (only where soils/conditions pass the rule).


Feature extraction: run local-relief/sky-view and semi-auto segmentation; generate ranked candidate list with thumbnails for ground truth.



Notes we’ll carry into contracting
Season picks: prioritize Jun–Aug south of the Equator (Brazzaville/Kinshasa side); flip to Nov–Mar windows north of it (Likouala etc.), acknowledging the Basin’s bimodal seasonality.


Authorities: AAC/RDC (DRC), ANAC (RoC) for air ops; IMNC/Ministry (DRC) for archaeology; ICCN/ACFAP for protected areas. Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
