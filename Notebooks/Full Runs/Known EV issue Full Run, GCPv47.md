Awesome—kicking off GCP V47 — Worth-It Realism Edition on a concrete, high-value EV problem and wiring it to run on Apache Spark from Day 1. Below is the full, self-contained initiation pack (Phase −1 and Phase 0), Spark execution plan, and go/no-go decision using V47’s gates.

PHASE −1 — Problem Discovery & Worth-It Sprint (NEW IN V47)
Problem Charter
Problem statement. Public DC fast charging (DCFC) frequently suffers from long waits and failed charging attempts, especially at peak travel periods. This produces “range/charging anxiety,” deters EV adoption, and wastes driver hours. Data show non-trivial failure rates and declining satisfaction at public chargers; regulators are moving to require high uptime and real-time status—creating both a need and an opportunity for prediction, routing, and reservation.

Goal. Reduce driver wait time and failed sessions by predicting queue length and reliability a priori, then assigning/holding soft reservations across multiple networks while respecting grid and site constraints.

Non-goals. We won’t build new chargers or modify vehicle firmware.

Stakeholder Map
Drivers (primary users): time cost, reliability, fairness across regions/income.

Charging networks (EA, EVgo, Tesla/NACS, FLO, utilities, site hosts): utilization smoothing, SLA compliance, grid constraints.

Regulators (state/federal): uptime/reporting compliance (e.g., CA 97% uptime with real-time data) and equitable access. 
Alternative Fuels Data Center
California Energy Commission e-Filing

Grid operators/utilities: demand spikes, demand charges, local capacity.

App/ecosystem partners: mapping, routing, payments.

Evidence Pack (selected)
~20% failed charging attempts at public stations (DCFC + L2) in 2024–2025 JD Power data; satisfaction remains low. 
J.D. Power

Reliability directly influences EV adoption; many stations not reliable; formal reliability metrics and resilience links highlighted by NREL (2024).

California implementing 97% uptime + real-time availability reporting—creates a real-time status substrate to build on (ideal pilot market). 
Alternative Fuels Data Center
California Energy Commission

Public charging ports are growing, but utilization at peaks still causes queues; wait times remain common. 
Alternative Fuels Data Center
Stable Auto

Do-Nothing Baseline
Drivers continue to show up blindly; peak days (holidays/summer) produce long queues; failure rates ~20% persist; grid sees spikier loads with little coordination. 
J.D. Power

Non-Tech Alternatives (serious options)
Holiday staffing & cones to marshal queues and triage faults.

Static signage & media advisories to shift demand to off-peak windows/nearby sites.

Regulatory audits & fines to push networks to fix uptime—helpful, but not predictive/routing-aware.

Feasibility–Impact Matrix (intervention classes)
Predict→Route→Reserve (PRR) (tech): High impact, High feasibility in CA (real-time data mandate), Medium elsewhere depending on network APIs. 
Alternative Fuels Data Center

Static ops fixes (non-tech): Medium impact, High feasibility.

Build more chargers (capex): Very high impact, low near-term feasibility (permits/supply chain).

Expected-Value Model (EVM) — rough order (pilot corridor, first year)
Benefit drivers: time saved (minutes per session) × sessions × value of time; avoided “failed session” detours; reduced congestion risk.

Benefit networks: smoother utilization (less queuing loss), better SLA/uptime compliance (avoid penalties), reputational gain.

Costs/risks: data access integrations; infra/compute; adoption friction; occasional overbooking “no-show” risk.

Result (risk-adjusted): PRR > Non-Tech > Do-Nothing across P50; PRR remains positive at P10 in CA due to data mandate and high peak pain. (Exact EV refined in Phase 0.)

Causal Sketch
Intervention PRR → (predict availability/wait) → (steer arrivals across time/nearby sites) → (lower queue length + fewer failed attempts) → improved satisfaction & adoption. Confounders: traffic waves, weather, local events, pricing. We will measure and control for these via streaming features.

Problem Red-Team (excerpt)
“What if real-time feeds are sparse outside CA?” → Scope pilot to CA first; design offline fallback (historical patterns + traffic + weather) and edge inference.

“Will drivers adopt reservations?” → Use soft-window reservations with overbooking bounds; no punitive fees, gamified incentives; measure uptake.

“What if networks don’t want cross-network holds?” → Start advisory + confidence-scored alternatives; add partner carrots (utilization smoothing, SLA metrics, analytics).

Premortem → Canary Indicators
P: Low adoption of reservations → Canary on reservation uptake rate; auto-fallback to advisory-only routing.

P: Bad predictions → Canary on p95 error > threshold → rollback to conservative baselines.

P: Data outages → Canary on feed freshness; switch to cached/historical model.

Ethics & Externalities
Fairness: don’t starve rural/low-income regions; enforce fairness constraints and publish deltas.

Privacy: no PII needed; only station-level telemetry and aggregate flows.

Gate C−0.5 — Should We Even Try? (Decision)
WIS (Worth-It Score): Impact 0.85; Tractability 0.70 (CA pilot), CausalPlaus 0.75, Adoption 0.65 (soft windows), Ethics 0.8, StrategicFit 0.8 → WIS ≈ 0.76 → PASS for R2 pilot (California corridors) with option to expand. (Rationale grounded in JD Power/NREL/CEC data.)

PHASE 0 — Domain Profile, Four-Fit, Assumptions, Budgets (REVISED IN V47)
Domain Profile (initial, CA pilot)
Primary metric: Wait time per arrival (minutes).
Tails: p50/p95/p99. Target: p95 ≤ 10 min at pilot sites during peak windows (90-day average).

Secondary metrics: Failed attempt rate (arrived & could not charge), reroute distance/time, driver satisfaction proxy (app thumbs-up), fairness deltas (rural/low-income vs baseline). JD Power shows ~20% failure attempts—baseline to beat. 
J.D. Power

Quality floors: No worse than baseline on failed attempts in any slice; no unfair regional skew.

Cost/Energy targets: Spark infra <$25k/quarter pilot; CO₂e negligible vs capex alternatives.

Realtime bounds: inference & recommendation latency < 2s for active user; data pipeline SLA (freshness ≤ 60s for station status; ≤15min for traffic/weather).

Bench params: N ≥ 30 replications; seed sweeps ≥ 10 for stochastic pipelines.

Hardware targets: Spark on cloud (k8s/YARN); GPUs optional (not required for tree-based models).

Budgets: compute_hours_max 3,000 in pilot; cost_ceiling_usd $100k (90 days).

Risk tier: R2 (moderate consequence; not safety-critical).

Do-Nothing & Non-Tech baselines: embedded (see Phase −1).

Expected-Value Model: maintained; updated with live telemetry.

Worth-It Score: 0.76 (see Gate C−0.5).

Falsification criteria:

If p95 wait not improved by ≥30% vs matched baseline corridors in 60 days → STOP/REFRAME (Minimal Intervention track).

If reservation uptake < 15% with no uplift in outcomes → disable holds, keep advisory prediction only.

If fairness regresses >0.5% on protected slices → block expansion pending mitigation.

Four-Fit (all green)
Problem–User Fit: Numerous reports of queues; JD Power dissatisfaction; real pain. 
J.D. Power
+1

Problem–World Fit: CA mandates real-time data + uptime; conducive regulatory context. 
Alternative Fuels Data Center

Solution–Problem Fit: Prediction→Routing directly targets queues/failures; causal sketch plausible.

Capability–Solution Fit: We control Spark infra and can integrate NREL AFDC metadata + partner feeds/API. AFDC APIs exist today for stations; CA pushes real-time availability. 
developer.nrel.gov
Alternative Fuels Data Center

Assumption Ledger (A-class)
A1: Sufficient real-time status feeds for a meaningful pilot (true in CA via policy; may need partners elsewhere). 
Alternative Fuels Data Center

A2: Predictions materially reduce wait vs “head there now” (to be proven with A/B at corridors).

A3: Soft-window reservations won’t increase “ghost holds” or unfairness (manage with bounded overbooking + penalties avoided; monitor canaries).

A4: Drivers will follow reroutes if confidence and savings are clear (UX + transparency).

A5: Cross-network advisory is acceptable without formal partnerships initially (we display confidence-scored alternatives).

Gate C0 — Eligibility (Decision)
PASS (complete Domain Profile, Four-Fit green, A-class tests defined, falsification & budgets set).

THE NOVEL SOLUTION (PRR): Predict → Route → (Soft) Reserve
Core idea. A Spark-powered Queue & Reliability Oracle that ingests real-time charger status, traffic, weather, historical patterns, and event calendars to predict per-site wait time and failure risk, then assigns optional time-window holds across nearby sites with stochastic overbooking tuned to live show-up rates and failure probabilities. Output integrates into routing apps (or our app) to steer arrivals and smooth utilization while enforcing fairness and grid constraints.

Why now? CA mandates real-time availability and 97% uptime for funded chargers—there’s finally data to do this right. 
Alternative Fuels Data Center

SPARK EXECUTION PLAN (READY TO RUN)
Data sources (initial)
Station metadata: AFDC Station Locator API (NREL) for site/connector attributes. 
developer.nrel.gov

Real-time availability: CA-compliant feeds from networks (OCPP 1.6/2.0.1 where possible); polling adapters per network; AFDC/EV-ChART where exposed. 
NREL Docs
Alternative Fuels Data Center

Aux: Traffic (provider API), weather (NOAA), local event calendars (web).

Optional: Anonymous app pings (opt-in) for ground truth wait/join times.

Ingestion & lakehouse
Spark Structured Streaming reading Kafka topics (per network feed) + REST polling micro-ingesters → Delta Lake bronze (raw OCPP/status), silver (cleaned & unified schema), gold (features & labels).

Schema (gold) per site×time window: slots_available, connectors_busy, faults, last_change_ts, est_queue_len, observed_wait, arrivals, departures, power_kW, price, traffic_speed, weather_bucket, event_flags.

Modeling (Spark ML on batch + micro-batch)
Queue/wait regression: Gradient-boosted trees or CatBoost-on-Spark equivalent; features: current load, trend slopes, connector mix, historical by DOW/holiday, traffic, weather, event flags.

Failure-risk classification: probability of “arrive & fail to charge” (down port, comms faults, blocked stalls).

Calibration: isotonic or Platt scaling (store reliability diagrams and ECE).

Fairness: constrained re-ranking in the router to avoid starving low-income/rural areas.

Routing & (Soft) Reservation engine
Assignment: online bipartite matching (driver→site/time) minimizing expected time cost with constraints (distance, grid hints, fairness weights).

Overbooking: bounded by predicted no-show and failure rates with guardrails; learn rates online.

APIs: REST endpoints: /predict, /route, /hold (time-window reservation), /release.

Latency budget: < 2s per query at P95.

Ops & CE (Phase 10 baked in)
Canaries: prediction error p95, reservation uptake, feed freshness; auto-rollback to advisory-only if thresholds breached.

Dashboards: wait/error CIs, fairness deltas, utilization smoothing, budget spend.

Cluster & costs (pilot)
Cluster: 1 driver (8 vCPU/32 GB), 6 workers (16 vCPU/64 GB each), autoscaling 3–10; Kafka (3 brokers, modest).

Storage: Delta Lake in object storage; 30-day hot, 180-day warm.

Budget: <$100k / 90 days (compute + storage + APIs). (Refined in Phase 7.)

MINIMAL INTERVENTION TRACK (per V47)
If PRR under-performs, ship Advisory-Only: publish predicted waits + confidence and ranked alternatives (no holds). Non-tech boost: holiday signage + SMS alerts with off-peak nudges.

RISK & ETHICS CONTROLS
Privacy: no PII—only station and aggregate flows.

Fairness: publish regional wait improvements; block deployment if any protected slice regresses >0.5%.

Transparency: display prediction confidence & rationale (e.g., “recent faults, weather surge”).

Compliance: SPDX/OSS scans, SBOM, signatures before release; CA uptime/data standards observed. 
Alternative Fuels Data Center

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (to enter Phase 1–2 quickly)
Data partnerships: secure CA network real-time feeds referenced by CEC standard; confirm AFDC API keys. 
developer.nrel.gov
Alternative Fuels Data Center

Corridor selection: CA I-5 + I-80 segments with diverse networks.

Labeling plan: instrument ground-truth wait (check-in/out telemetry via app or site sensors).

A/B design: corridor-pairing with matched controls (Do-Nothing baseline).

Spark infra: provision cluster; deploy bronze/silver/gold Delta tables & streaming skeletons; ship /predict v0 with historical-only baseline.

Red-team pass #2 (end of Phase 2): attack assumptions; finalize Minimal Intervention pivot triggers.

DECISION (Gate Recap)
C−0.5 (Should We Even Try?): PASS for R2 CA pilot based on credible pain and policy-enabled data.

C0 (Eligibility): PASS (Domain Profile, Four-Fit, A-assumptions, falsification, budgets set).

If you want, I can spin up the Spark artifacts next: Delta schemas, Structured Streaming job skeletons, and the first /predict baseline (historical median + traffic/weather correction) so we can start collecting evaluation data immediately.

Awesome — proceeding to fully spin up V47 on the Spark track for the EV fast-charging reliability/queuing problem. Below you’ll find:

ready-to-use Delta schemas, Kafka topics, and Spark Structured Streaming jobs (bronze → silver → gold);

a baseline /predict model (historical + queueing prior) you can ship today;

a minimal routing & soft-reservation API skeleton;

canaries, A/B, and runbook steps wired to V47 gates.

Where I reference policy/data standards or protocol fields, I cite current primary sources (CEC 97% uptime + real-time data, AFDC APIs, OCPP). These directly justify the design choices (e.g., real-time feeds, status semantics).

0) Context checkpoints (why this is the right pilot and data fit)
California requires 97% uptime for state/ratepayer-funded chargers and real-time availability, accessibility and pricing data via API — this creates the exact substrate we need for predictive queuing and cross-network advisory/holds.

Labeling (wait time): Where we have ground truth (app check-in/out or site sensors), compute label_wait_minutes as join-to-plug start minus arrival; for sparse labels, we will backstop with a queueing prior (see 3.2).

3) Baseline model & /predict service
We ship a baseline that is honest and robust: a quantile historical model blended with a queueing prior (M/M/c approximation) using the current busy/total ports and recent arrival rates; add exogenous corrections (traffic, weather, events). This gives calibrated P50/P80/P95 waits now, while more complex learners are trained offline and rolled forward under Gate C7.Sigma.

Why this baseline is valid on day one: It’s transparent, bounded, and fuses historic wait distributions with a queueing-theory prior that reacts to current occupancy. It’s conservative when the system nears saturation, reducing “confidently wrong” risk (V47 principle).

The status semantics in upstream feeds match OCPP’s StatusNotification categories; we normalize all vendor data to those states, so /predict is station-agnostic and cross-network by design.

5) A/B experiment & canaries (V47 Phases 6, 10)
A/B corridor pairing

Control: standard maps to nearest charger.

Treatment A: advisory routing with predicted waits (no holds).

Treatment B: advisory + soft window holds with bounded overbooking (learned no-show).

Primary KPI: p95 wait time per arrival (match-controlled by hour/day/traffic region). Minimum detectable effect: 30% reduction (V47 falsification rule).

Canaries (auto-rollback triggers)

Prediction error: MAE > 5 min or p95 error > 12 min → rollback to advisory-only.

Reservation uptake: < 15% with no wait reduction → disable holds; keep advisory.

Feed freshness: > 60s gap sustained → switch to cached/historical baseline.

Wire these into CE Phase-10 alarms; map premortem indicators to alerts.

6) Fairness, privacy, and compliance hooks (V47)
Fairness: compute regional deltas (rural/low-income slices) of wait improvements; block expansion if any protected slice regresses >0.5% (C9 blocker).

Privacy: no PII; only station-level and aggregate flows.

Compliance: include SBOM, SPDX license scan, and signing/attestation before release; CA real-time data and uptime rules satisfied by our read-only integration posture.

Backfills: daily AFDC snapshot to “silver.station_inventory” (AFDC APIs).

Model refresh: nightly rolling quantiles; weekly recalibration; promotion gated by C7.Sigma.

Scaling: autoscale Spark 3→10 workers on peak travel weekends; Z-ORDER station_id, ts_5m in Delta for fast point reads.

Incident: if canary trips, auto-rollback to advisory-only, page on-call, and open an incident template.

Observability: expose prediction error distribution, feed freshness, reservation uptake; dashboards for tails and fairness deltas.

8) Next 48 hours — concrete checklist
Provision cluster (Spark 3.5, Delta 3+) and Kafka; apply table DDLs above.

Deploy bronze/silver jobs; run AFDC metadata snapshotter; verify station cross-refs.

Stand up /predict baseline; serve from latest gold.predictions.

A/B wiring in the app (feature flag) on two CA corridors.

Canaries: configure Prometheus alerts → rollback script.

Notes on sources & standards used
CA 97% uptime + real-time API sharing for funded chargers provides the regulatory lever and data we count on in the pilot.

J.D. Power shows measurable room for improvement in unsuccessful attempts (16% in Q1-2025); our KPI targets are realistic and meaningful.

NREL emphasizes reliability’s link to adoption; AFDC is the canonical metadata source, and EV-ChART outlines reporting rhythms (helpful for backfills).

OCPP and StatusNotification semantics ground our normalization of vendor feeds; the OCA’s 2024 uptime monitoring note shows what to monitor in 1.6 vs 2.0.1.

If you want, I can tailor these to your exact cloud (Databricks, EMR, GKE on Spark Operator, or on-prem), and generate IaC (Terraform + Helm) to deploy Kafka, Delta storage, Spark checkpoints, and the FastAPI service behind your ingress.
