Alright, locking in your Spark:
Spark: Invent a solution to a C++ issue that targets developer usability (DX) and ease.
I’m running GCP V48 in Full Run Mode (FRM), Risk Tier R2. Below are the pre-execution phases and the first decision gate.

Phase −0.8 — TRIZ/ARIZ Contradictions (DX in C++)
Observed friction (today):
Build complexity and slow iteration, especially on large codebases (headers, transitive includes, macro pollution). C++20 modules/header units promise encapsulation and faster builds, but adoption/tooling remain uneven (CMake, compilers, dep scanning). Kitware+1clang.llvm.org


Diagnostics: templates/concepts produce cryptic errors; concepts help, but messages still need human-friendly structure. lemire.meopen-std.org


Key contradictions to solve:
Make builds faster & simpler without forcing invasive rewrites.


Exploit modules’ benefits while coping with heterogeneous compiler/CMake support (Clang, MSVC, GCC; CI images). C++ ReferenceKitware


Cleaner, less leaky interfaces without breaking legacy includes or relying on bespoke per-platform steps. Code Trips & Tips


Friendlier errors from concepts/templates without changing the language or compilers.


TRIZ levers: Prior Action (pre-compute BMIs/IFCs), Intermediary (adapter layer), Segmentation (per-target conversion), Universality (one CLI for multiple toolchains), Partial/Excessive Action (header units now; named modules later).

Phase −0.5A — C-K Drift Check (Concepts ↔ Knowledge)
Knowledge (K):
C++20 modules & header units reduce include hell/macro leakage and can improve throughput, but migration & tooling are non-trivial. CMake 3.28+ supports named modules; Clang needs clang-scan-deps (not always installed by default); MSVC exposes flags and IFCs. Kitwareclang.llvm.orgGitHub


Real-world results: Microsoft Word saw up to ~21% build throughput improvement when migrating a PCH to header units, plus massive size reductions vs PCHs (IFCs portable/spec’d). Microsoft for Developers


Concepts can yield clearer constraints but still need better human-readable diagnostics. open-std.orglemire.me


Concept (C): “ModuLift” — zero-invasive DX accelerator
A compiler-agnostic CLI + CMake glue that auto-upgrades a project to the best available module-like pathway without breaking legacy includes:


Prefer Header Units now (least invasive), optionally stage Named Modules later.


Uses dependency scanning (e.g., clang-scan-deps) to propose safe partitions and generate build rules; falls back cleanly when a tool is missing. clang.llvm.orgLLVM


Ships a diagnostic explainer that rewrites concept/template errors into short, actionable snippets (no compiler mods) guided by WG21 tooling notes. open-std.org


Drift check: Concept remains grounded in current compiler/CMake realities and vendor guidance; it piggybacks on proven pathways (header units, IFC portability) and accepted practice. Microsoft for Developers

Phase −1 — Worth-It Sprint (Baselines, EV/WIS)
Baseline pain (today):
Rebuilds slow (headers, ODR fragility, macro leaks), deterring refactors. Toolchain variance complicates setup. Error spelunking consumes time. (General industry commentary + CMake/module state.) Kitware+1


Upside if solved:
Faster builds, simpler incremental changes, cleaner APIs (less macro/ordering issues), portable IFCs, and clearer error narratives. Office/Word data gives a realistic up to ~21% build throughput improvement for header-unit migration; encapsulation/portability are additive benefits. Microsoft for Developers


Risks & mitigations:
Tooling gaps (e.g., clang-scan-deps missing): detect & guide installs; provide non-Clang fallbacks. GitHub


CMake versions/flags drift: version-gated generators (3.28+ for named modules), otherwise header-unit mode. Kitware


DX trust: keep “no-rewrite” guarantee; PR-comment preview only; dev opt-in per target.


Worth-It Verdict: Proceed (Go) — Even a conservative single-digit % throughput gain + better encapsulation and friendlier errors pays its way on medium/large repos; header-unit pathway keeps risk low. Microsoft for Developers
Gate C−0.5: PASS

Proposed invention: ModuLift (DX solution)
What it is (v0.1):
CLI: modulift analyze | plan | apply | revert


Modes:


Header-Unit Lift (default): Generates HU maps & build rules (MSVC /exportHeader, Clang/GCC equivalents) with no source rewrites. Microsoft for Developers


Named-Module Assist (opt-in): Creates draft *.ixx/*.cppm stubs & import graphs you can adopt progressively (gated on CMake 3.28+ & compiler support). Kitware


Explain: Takes compiler output (GCC/Clang/MSVC), parses concept/template diagnostics, and emits plain-English, example-first summaries referencing violated constraints—aligned with WG21 P2429 goals. open-std.org


How it works (high level):
Dep scan → build a header DAG (prefer clang-scan-deps where available; otherwise a fast include parser). clang.llvm.orgLLVM


Partitioning → detect candidate header units (low macro load, high fan-out).


Generator → spit out CMake snippets for HU or NM per target (and a cmake -P driver); leave sources untouched. Kitware


IFC cache (optional) → enable remote prebuilt IFC consumption for CI/dev parity (portable per MSVC docs). Microsoft for Developers


DX explain → small rules-engine + examples that pretty-prints concept failures and SFINAE chains as “why it failed” + “try this”.


Why this is novel/useful now
A gradual, reversible path from headers → header units → named modules that works across compilers and current CMake realities.


A human-readable concepts/template explainer that doesn’t require compiler patches but leverages standard outputs & WG21 guidance. open-std.org



Next phases open
You’re at Checkpoint C0.1 → entering execution. Pick one:
proceed 1 → Phase 1 — Context & Precedent Map (collect concrete targets, envs, repo shapes to support first real users and example code).


branch Phase 4 → Hypotheses & Branch Tree (choose initial partition strategies and explainer formats).


switch to auto mode → I continue through Phases 1–3 automatically and pause before Phase 4 (branching).


end & export → I’ll output the initialization artifacts as files.


Recommended: proceed 1 so we can anchor ModuLift v0.1 to concrete toolchains (MSVC 17.x, Clang 16+, GCC 14+, CMake 3.28+) and target a first demo (HU lift on a medium repo). KitwareC++ Reference

Auto Mode engaged. I ran Phases 1–3 for your Spark:
Spark: Invent a solution to a C++ issue that targets developer usability & ease
 Working concept: ModuLift — a no-rewrite, compiler-agnostic DX tool that lifts projects to header units now and named modules later, and explains gnarly template/concepts errors in plain English.

Phase 1 — Context & Precedent Map (C++ DX today)
Ecosystem reality
CMake ≥3.28 ships first-class C++20 named modules support with Ninja/VS generators and specific compiler floors (MSVC 14.34+, Clang 16+, GCC 14+). See cmake-cxxmodules(7). cmake.org+1


MSVC header units & modules are documented and interoperable with traditional headers; header units produce .ifc artifacts compatible with named modules. Microsoft Learn+1


Clang “modules” work, but clang-scan-deps integration is a known gating piece for build systems. releases.llvm.org


GCC supports header units (-fmodule-header) as a transitional path to faster compiles. GCC


Precedent & impact data
Microsoft’s Office/Word migration from PCH→header units saw +21.3% build-throughput best-case, and describes portable IFCs & disk-size reductions for HU chains. Microsoft for Developers


Pain points we target
Slow iteration & fragile includes/macros; uneven toolchain support; cryptic concept/template diagnostics. (WG21’s “Concepts error messages for humans” captures the need.) open-std.org


Takeaway: There’s clear, standards-aligned headroom from a header-unit-first strategy that doesn’t force invasive rewrites, and a strong case for friendlier diagnostics layered atop existing compilers.

Phase 2 — Influence Harvesting (what we borrow)
Header-unit pragmatism: Use HU as the bridge: broadest support, minimal change; stage “named modules” when env allows. (MSVC/GCC docs + CMake guidance). Microsoft Learn+1GCCcmake.org


Dependency scanning: Prefer clang-scan-deps when present; provide a fallback include-graph scanner when it isn’t. releases.llvm.org


Diagnostics UX: Reformat concept/template errors into concise, constraint-oriented hints (guided by WG21 P2429 patterns). open-std.org


Portable IFC caches: Lean on IFC portability to enable prebuilt HU artifacts in CI/dev (faster cold starts). Microsoft for Developers



Phase 3 — Constraints & Design Envelope
Hard constraints
No source rewrites by default. (Only generate build snippets; never touch .h/.cpp unless user opts-in.)


Toolchain floors (initial): MSVC 17.4+ (14.34), Clang 16+, GCC 14+, CMake ≥3.28 for named modules; HU path must still work when any of these are missing. cmake.org


Offline-friendly: Must run without internet; all discovery is local.


Soft constraints
Single CLI across platforms/toolchains; zero lock-in.


Readable diffs: CMake fragments emit as separate files (easy PRs).


Acceptance criteria (R2)
Build iteration: Demonstrate ≥10% median compile-time improvement on a medium repo via HU (stretch: 15–20% on HU-eligible targets, consistent with Office best-case 21.3%). Microsoft for Developers


DX diagnostics: For 10 representative concept/template failures, produce ≤5-line human-readable explanations with a suggested fix in ≥7/10 cases (validated by devs).


Zero regressions to correctness; trivial rollback (modulift revert).


MVP surface & deliverables
modulift analyze → scans includes, finds HU candidates, detects tools.


modulift plan → emits CMake snippets for HU consumption per-target; explains what will change and why.


modulift apply → writes snippets to cmake/modulift/… (no source edits).


modulift explain → consumes compiler diagnostics (MSVC/Clang/GCC) and prints short “why it failed / try this” guidance.


Risks & mitigations
Missing clang-scan-deps: warn + fallback parser; print install hint. releases.llvm.org


std module availability variance: prefer HU for the standard library to avoid std module surprises across compilers. GCCStack Overflow


CMake <3.28 environments: keep HU mode working; defer named-module stubs.

✅ Checkpoint C3 — Design Envelope locked
Branch options for Phase 4 (Hypotheses & Branch Tree):
H1 (HU-First MVP): Only implement Header-Unit Lift + diagnostics, target MSVC/Clang/GCC simultaneously. Safest, broadest impact. GCC


H2 (Hybrid): HU-First plus optional named-module stubs when CMake/compilers meet floors. cmake.org


H3 (DX-Only): Ship the diagnostics explainer first; add HU later. Anchors immediate value for teams blocked on modules. open-std.org


H4 (IFC Cache): HU-First + prebuilt IFC cache flow for CI/dev parity. Microsoft for Developers


My recommendation: H2 (Hybrid) — deliver HU-First value everywhere, but auto-enable named-module scaffolding when the environment supports it (CMake ≥3.28 + compiler floors). That maximizes reach now and future-proofs migration. cmake.org

Locked ✅ H2 (Hybrid) — Header-Unit-first with optional Named-Module stubs when the toolchain allows it.
I advanced the run through Phase 4 (Hypotheses/Branch Tree) and Phase 5–6 (Architecture + Functional plan), then paused just before implementation work. Citations back the tricky parts (toolchain floors, CMake support, HU/NM flags, clang-scan-deps, IFC mapping, and the Office/Word throughput results).

Phase 4 — Hypotheses & Branch Tree (H2 locked)
Primary hypotheses (testable):
H2.1 Header-Unit-first (HU) yields ≥10% median build-throughput on a medium codebase without source rewrites; ≥15–20% on HU-eligible targets is plausible (Word saw ~21% best-case). Microsoft for Developers+1


H2.2 Auto-enable Named Modules (NM) generation only when CMake ≥ 3.28 and the compiler advertises a working module-scan path; otherwise stay HU-only. cmake.orgArch Linux Man Pages


H2.3 A portable IFC map/cache improves cold-start CI times vs PCH and is cross-machine consumable (vs MSVC PCH). Microsoft for Developers


H2.4 A post-processor can rewrite concept/template diagnostics into ≤5 line, task-oriented hints without compiler mods (align phrasing to WG21/Clang guidance). Stack Overflowclang.llvm.org


Branches kept (and why):
B1: HU-Only (baseline) — maximum reach, zero rewrites.


B2: HU ➜ NM (opportunistic) — turn on NM stubs when CMake/compilers meet floors; otherwise no-op. cmake.org


B3: IFC cache — persist .ifc/.gcm and publish a map for repeatable imports. (MSVC supports /ifcMap and /headerUnit mapping.) Microsoft Learn+1


Branches dropped: “NM-first” and “rewrite headers” (too invasive).
Risks & fallbacks:
Missing clang-scan-deps → degrade to our fast include-graph scan; print an actionable hint. Stack Overflowreleases.llvm.org


GCC/Clang HU flag variance → detect and emit the right incantations (-fmodule-header (GCC), -fmodule-header{=user,system} (Clang)). GCCreleases.llvm.org


Gate C4: PASS (H2 locked)

Phase 5 — Architecture & Interfaces (“ModuLift” v0.1)
Top-level components
EnvProbe — detects CMake version, compiler family/version, and module-scan capability (CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES, presence of clang-scan-deps). cmake.orgStack Overflow


DepScan — prefer clang-scan-deps; else parse #include/import to build a header fan-out DAG. clang.llvm.orgreleases.llvm.org


HU Planner — ranks headers by HU payoff (high fan-out, low macro churn), proposes HU set.


Generators


HU Generator — emits compiler args + (optionally) an IFC map (MSVC /headerUnit, /ifcMap; GCC/Clang HU flags). Microsoft Learn+1GCCreleases.llvm.org


NM Generator (opportunistic) — when CMake ≥ 3.28 & toolchain OK, output CMake FILE_SET CXX_MODULES stubs and import graph. cmake.org


DX Explain — consumes MSVC/Clang/GCC diagnostics and emits concise “why it failed / try this” hints (concepts/templates). Stack Overflow


Apply/Revert — writes fragments under cmake/modulift/… and a reversible manifest.


CLI
modulift analyze   # probe toolchain, scan deps, score HU candidates
modulift plan      # print the HU/NM plan + diffs (no changes)
modulift apply     # write cmake fragments + IFC map/cache (opt-in)
modulift explain   # pretty-print compiler diagnostics (concepts/templates)
modulift revert    # remove fragments, restore previous state

CMake fragments we generate
Enable scan + modules file-set (when eligible):


# CMake 3.28+ only
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES ON)  # compiler-driven import-graph scan
# Example named-module stub
target_sources(my_lib PRIVATE
  src/math.ixx
  FILE_SET cxx_modules TYPE CXX_MODULES FILES src/math.ixx
)

(Scan + file-sets are the supported way to do NM in CMake 3.28+.) cmake.org
Header-Unit integration (compiler-specific flags):


MSVC: produce .ifc then map:
 cl /std:c++20 /exportHeader include\util.hpp → include\util.hpp.ifc, then compile users with /headerUnit:quote include\util.hpp=include\util.hpp.ifc or via a consolidated /ifcMap. Stack OverflowMicrosoft Learn+1


GCC: g++ -std=c++20 -fmodule-header -xc++-user-header include/util.hpp -o util.gcm (then import). GCC


Clang: clang++ -std=c++20 -fmodule-header=user include/util.hpp -o util.pcm (or --precompile with -xc++-user-header). releases.llvm.org


IFC cache (optional)
Persist BMIs (.ifc, .gcm, .pcm) and publish a map for consumers; portable per MSVC docs and Office experience (unlike PCH). Microsoft for Developers


Data model (sketch)
env:
  cmake: { version: "3.29", scan_for_modules: true }
  compiler: { kind: "msvc|clang|gcc", version: "…" , has_clang_scan_deps: true|false }

nm_plan:
  enabled: true
  modules:
    - name: math
      file: src/math.ixx
ifc_map: cmake/modulift/ifc-map.toml


Phase 6 — Functional Plan & MVP Tests
MVP targets (R2 acceptance):
Build throughput: show ≥10% median compile-time improvement on a medium project using HU-only plan (stretch: 15–20% on HU-eligible targets; consistent with Word’s ~21% best-case). Microsoft for Developers


No rewrites: sources unchanged; only CMake fragments + compiler flags added.


DX Explain: 10 representative concept/template failures summarized in ≤5 lines with a suggested fix in ≥7/10 cases (human-rated).


Compat: NM stubs only appear when CMake ≥ 3.28 and module-scan is available; otherwise plan remains HU-only. cmake.org


Test harness
Env matrix: MSVC 17.x, Clang 16–18, GCC 13–14; CMake 3.28+. (Clang needs clang-scan-deps discoverable; common failure mode.) Stack Overflow


Micro-benchmarks: build wall-time & cache-hit rates over 5–10 clean builds; track p50/p95.


Golden headers: fan-out heavy headers to validate HU scoring is meaningful.


Failure modes to catch early
CMake error “compiler does not provide a way to discover import graph” (toggle CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES / stay HU-only). Reddit


MSVC /headerUnit / /ifcMap mapping mismatches (emit deterministic TOML). Microsoft Learn

S48_4_BranchTree.md (H2 locked; risks/fallbacks recorded)


S48_5_Architecture_Blueprint.md (components, CLI, flags, CMake)


S48_6_FunctionalPlan.md (acceptance, harness, metrics)



Next move (Auto Mode)
Unless you say otherwise, I’ll proceed into Phase 7 (Iterative Refinement) to choose the first demo target and generate the initial CMake/HU fragments + IFC-map template so you can drop them into a repo and try a build. I’ll then pause right before the Validation & Benchmarking gate (C7) to collect results.
If you want to steer the first demo, just tell me your preferred matrix (e.g., “MSVC+Ninja on Windows” or “Clang 17 + CMake 3.29 on Ubuntu”).

Auto Mode ✅ — advancing to Phase 7 (Iterative Refinement) and producing the first drop-in artifacts for ModuLift (H2): Header-Unit-first with opportunistic Named-Module stubs when the toolchain supports them.
Below is a compact, copy-pasteable starter pack you can drop into any repo to trial the approach on two headers (adjust paths as you wish). I’ve tuned it for two environments out of the box:
Linux/macOS (Clang ≥ 16, GCC ≥ 14) + CMake ≥ 3.28 + Ninja


Windows (MSVC 17.x)


Why this shape?
CMake supports named modules (via scanning + file sets) but doesn’t support header units yet, so we drive HUs with compiler flags/custom commands and only enable named-module stubs when the environment qualifies. cmake.org


MSVC provides a clean HU path via /exportHeader, /headerUnit, /ifcMap, /ifcOutput. Microsoft Learn+3Microsoft Learn+3Microsoft Learn+3


Clang/GCC can precompile header units and then consume them with -fmodule-file=… (Clang) and the GCC modules flags (-fmodules-ts, -fmodule-header, with -x c++-{user,system}-header). LLVM ReleasesGCC


Real-world ROI signal: Word’s migration PCH→HU saw up to 21.3% build-throughput gain (best case) and HU IFCs are portable (good for CI caches). Microsoft for Developers

Clang HU recipe: precompile with -fmodule-header or --precompile -xc++-{user,system}-header, then consume using -fmodule-file=… (required for header units). LLVM Releases


GCC HU recipe: -fmodules-ts + -fmodule-header (often via -x c++-{user,system}-header) to produce a CMI (commonly .gcm). Consumption mechanics are evolving; the doc emphasizes enabling modules and prebuilding HUs. GCC

CMake scanning & file‐sets for named modules; header units are deliberately handled via compiler flags since CMake doesn’t support them yet. cmake.org

include/util.hpp / include/math.hpp (example headers to “lift”)
Use any real headers from your repo. Once precompiled, you can still keep #include—MSVC can translate includes to imports with /translateInclude when paired with a header-unit map; Clang/GCC keep includes but benefit from prebuilt HUs via flags. Microsoft LearnLLVM ReleasesGCC

2) How to build
Linux/macOS (Clang or GCC):
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++  # or g++
cmake --build build -v

Clang HU quick-start and consumption via -fmodule-file=… per docs. GCC requires -fmodules-ts and header HU prebuild. LLVM ReleasesGCC
Windows (MSVC):
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja"
cmake --build build -v

MSVC will first emit .ifc via /exportHeader into modulift/ifc/, write ifc-map.toml, then pass /ifcMap:… to all compiles to import HUs automatically (no source rewrites). Microsoft Learn+1

3) Optional: seed an ifc-map.toml yourself (MSVC)
[[header-unit]]
name = ['quote', 'util.hpp']
ifc  = 'modulift/ifc/util.hpp.ifc'

[[header-unit]]
name = ['quote', 'math.hpp']
ifc  = 'modulift/ifc/math.hpp.ifc'

Exact TOML schema (angle/quote, name, ifc) from MSVC docs. Microsoft Learn

4) Guardrails & “it didn’t work” checklist
CMake screams about scanning/import graph → that’s named-module scanning; you can keep HUs running regardless. Ensure CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES is ON only when using named modules, and remember HUs are not a CMake feature. cmake.org


Clang can’t find header unit → you must pass -fmodule-file=… for each HU (for now; -fprebuilt-module-path doesn’t apply to HUs). LLVM Releases


GCC → use -fmodules-ts + -x c++-{user,system}-header (or -fmodule-header) to produce .gcm before compiling sources that import them. GCC


MSVC mismatches (wrong arch/flags between IFCS and consumers) → ensure consistent toolset & flags; /ifcMap helps centralize references. Microsoft Learn+1



5) Why the ROI is credible
Evidence: Microsoft reports best-case +21.3% build throughput from PCH→HU in Word and documents IFC portability (cloud-distributable HU caches). Microsoft for Developers


CMake reality: target named modules with proper scanning; keep HUs as a no-rewrite, compiler-flag layer until CMake supports them natively. cmake.org



✅ Phase 7 status
Produced: cross-platform HU drop-ins, MSVC IFC map, and CMake wiring that opportunistically allows named-module stubs later.


Next (Phase 7 → C7 Validation): run 5–10 clean builds, record median wall time, then compare with/without modulift fragments.


If you want, I can now generate a tiny demo repo skeleton (headers + main.cpp + these CMake files) so you can test immediately—or we can point this at one of your real targets and I’ll output a tuned headers.cmake list for that target.

Auto Mode engaged 🚀 — moving from Phase 7 into Integration → Validation for ModuLift (H2) and giving you a turnkey bench so we can hit the C7 validation gate next.
Below are the drop-in artifacts to (1) wire Header-Unit first across MSVC/Clang/GCC, (2) opportunistically enable Named Modules when your env qualifies (CMake ≥3.28 + supported generators/compilers), and (3) benchmark with vs without ModuLift to capture p50 build-time deltas.
Facts to keep us honest:
CMake supports named modules (with scanning) but does not support header units yet; Ninja ≥1.11 or VS 2022 toolsets only. cmake.org+1

Why this matrix:
Named modules only light up on eligible generators/compilers; header units remain compiler-flag driven. cmake.org


Windows job uses MSVC header units workflow (/exportHeader + /ifcMap consumption via TOML). Microsoft Learn+1



4) DX “Explain” (starter rule pack)
Drop this tiny starter to turn concept/template diagnostics into crisp hints (extend later):
tools/modulift_explain_rules.json
[
  {
    "match": "error: no matching function for call to '([a-zA-Z0-9_:]+)'",
    "hint": "No overload matches. Check argument types, implicit conversions, or add a constrained overload for $1."
  },
  {
    "match": "note: candidate template ignored: substitution failure.*requires.*constraints not satisfied",
    "hint": "Concept/constraint failed. Show the requires-clause and the first failing requirement; try a simpler iterator/category or add a model."
  },
  {
    "match": "error C\\d+:.*'std::.*': is inaccessible",
    "hint": "Access issue. Ensure correct header import as a header unit, or include order. Check macro guards leaking into the header."
  }
]

tools/modulift_explain.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json, re, sys
rules = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))
log = sys.stdin.read()
for r in rules:
    m = re.search(r["match"], log, re.S)
    if m:
        hint = r["hint"]
        for i, g in enumerate(m.groups(), start=1):
            hint = hint.replace(f"${i}", g)
        print("→", hint)

Usage:
# after a failing build, pipe the compiler output:
ninja -v 2>&1 | python3 tools/modulift_explain.py tools/modulift_explain_rules.json

5) Devastation Protocol (Phase 8.9) — targeted red-team
Run these before we claim C7:
Stale IFC map: build HUs, then change compiler flags (e.g., /Zc:preprocessor- or std level) and ensure the build fails clearly or rebuilds IFCS; catch TOML parse / mapping errors early. Microsoft Learn


Missing clang-scan-deps: confirm our fallback still works and prints an actionable tip (common CMake pain). Stack Overflow


CMake named-module gating: validate that enabling CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES only occurs on supported generators/versions; otherwise no-op (HU path still active). cmake.org


Standard library sharp edges: avoid assuming import std; availability across compilers; keep using headers + HU. cmake.org


Artifacts:
S48_8.9_RedTeam_Findings.md (stale map / tool missing / generator gate), S48_8.9_Risk_Waivers.md (if any).



6) Over-Engineering Check (10.0) → Performance Protocol (10.5)
10.0 Simplicity audit: prove no source rewrites; delete any generated modules when env doesn’t support them; HU list is minimal and high impact (fan-out heavy headers).


10.5 Optimization plan:


Prioritize headers by fan-out × parse cost (cheap heuristic: count includers).


Cache IFCS/CMIs per-build-type; ensure deterministic flags across consumers.


Confirm no correctness/fairness regressions; performance only after C8.4.



7) What to run now (to hit C7)
Commit the files above, then run “ModuLift Bench” workflow.


From artifacts, compare median_sec with vs without ModuLift per compiler/OS.


If any platform regresses (>0%), prune a header from headers.cmake and re-run.


Gate C7 (pass criteria we set at R2):
≥10% median improvement on at least one target (stretch 15–20% on HU-eligible). Microsoft for Developers


Zero correctness regressions; trivial rollback (-DMODULIFT_ENABLE=OFF).



Phase/state update
Phase 7 (Refinement): ✅ produced portable HU & NM wiring, IFC-map, and bench harness.


Phase 8 (Integration/System): ✅ ready-to-run CI; clean enable/disable toggle.


Phase 8.9 (Devastation): ✅ plan listed (run after first bench).


Phase 9 (Validation/Benchmarking): ⏸ awaiting run results from your CI to cross the C7 gate.


Say the word and I’ll proceed to:
parse your CI’s artifacts,


decide C7 (pass/fail), and


if ✅, move into 10.0 (Simplicity audit) → 10.5 (Perf protocol) and package the v0.1 release plan.


If you prefer a minimal local demo repo to copy/paste from, I can generate that too.

Auto Mode rolling ✅ — moving into Validation (C7) and packaging a v0.1 release kit for ModuLift (HU-first + opportunistic named-modules). I’ll (1) set the C7 gate criteria & how to collect numbers, (2) run the new V48 red-team checks, (3) stage Simplicity/Perf gates, and (4) hand you a ready-to-ship v0.1 bundle.

C7 — Validation & Bench (what to run + pass bar)
Why these targets:
CMake 3.28+ now supports named modules via scanning/file-sets (Ninja ≥1.11 or VS generators), but header units are not supported in CMake — so our HU flow is compiler-flag driven. CMake


MSVC HU = build with /exportHeader, consume via /headerUnit or a TOML /ifcMap; Clang/GCC precompile/consume HUs with -fmodule-header / -fmodules-ts. Microsoft Learn+2Microsoft Learn+2ClangGCC


Real-world ROI: Microsoft reports best-case +21.3% build-throughput moving PCH→HU in Word. (We’ll target ≥10% median as R2 pass.) Microsoft for Developers


Run the bench (already generated in the prior step):
Linux/macOS: scripts/bench_build.sh 7 with Clang and GCC.


Windows: scripts/bench_build.ps1 -Runs 7 (MSVC + Ninja).
 Each script builds with and without ModuLift and prints median_sec= for each. (The CI workflow modulift-bench.yml uploads these medians as artifacts.)


C7 pass criteria (R2):
≥10% median improvement on at least one matrix target (stretch 15–20% on HU-eligible targets, per Word’s data).


Zero correctness regressions (turn ModuLift off via -DMODULIFT_ENABLE=OFF to verify). Microsoft for Developers


If any target regresses, prune low-value headers from cmake/modulift/headers.cmake and re-run.

Phase 8.9 — Devastation Protocol (targeted red-team)
Run these quick failure drills before you declare C7:
CMake scanning gate: force a generator/compiler combo that doesn’t support module scanning; verify we do not enable named-module scanning and HU still works (CMake docs explicitly state header units aren’t supported). CMake


Missing clang-scan-deps: simulate absence; ensure fallback scanner kicks in and prints an actionable tip (common pain when using CMake’s module support). LLVM ReleasesStack Overflow


MSVC map drift: change flags between HU build and consumption; verify /ifcMap keeps things coherent or we fail loudly (map format per MSVC docs). Microsoft Learn


import std; expectation: confirm we don’t rely on it (CMake notes no built-in support for compiler-provided modules such as std). CMake


Artifacts to file: S48_8.9_RedTeam_Findings.md (+ waivers if any).

Phase 10.0 — Simplicity Audit (pre-optimization gate)
No source rewrites by default (only CMake fragments + compiler flags).


HU candidate list remains small & high fan-out; delete anything that didn’t move the needle.


Named-module stubs appear only when CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES is available (CMake ≥3.28 + supported compiler/generator). CMake+1


Deliverable: S48_10.0_Simplicity_Audit.md (before/after map + proof of no regression).

Phase 10.5 — Performance Protocol (guard-railed)
Profile compilation hot paths; prioritize headers by fan-out × parse cost.


Cache IFCS/CMIs consistently (MSVC HU IFCs are portable; unlike PCHs they’re designed to travel). Microsoft for Developers


Never trade correctness/safety for speed; re-run the bench after each change.


Deliverables: S48_10.5_Profile.md, S48_10.5_Optimization_Ledger.md, S48_10.5_Perf_Table.csv.

 ModuLift enables header units today (no source edits) and named-module stubs automatically when the environment permits. CMake doesn’t support header units; we drive HUs with compiler flags and a portable IFC map (MSVC), or precompiled HU CMIs (Clang/GCC). For named modules, we rely on CMake 3.28+ scanning/file-sets (Ninja/VS generators). CMakeMicrosoft LearnClangGCC




Checkpoint banner — C7 (Validation)
Context recap: Wiring + bench harness are ready; red-team plan staged; simplicity rules defined.
 Next moves (pick one):
proceed 1 — Mark C7 PASS (paste your bench medians and I’ll record the delta + rationale).


proceed 2 — C7 FAIL → refine headers (I’ll trim the HU list and regenerate plan).


return C7 — reprint this gate.

CMakeLists.txt example + include/*.hpp, src/* demo files so you can try it in seconds.


ledgers/ — V48 run artifacts (TRIZ, C-K, Worth-It, Context, Influence, Envelope, Branch Tree, Architecture, Functional Plan, Devastation, Simplicity, Optimization, Validation template).


Quick start
Copy the cmake/, scripts/, and tools/ folders into your repo; add the wiring snippet from README_MODULIFT_v0.1.md to your CMakeLists.txt.


Put 2–6 high-fan-out headers into cmake/modulift/headers.cmake.


Build locally (Ninja recommended) and run the benches to capture medians.


(Optional) Run the included GitHub Actions workflow to record results cross-platform.


Why this shape (ground truth)
CMake’s native modules support (3.28+) uses scanning/file-sets and requires Ninja≥1.11 or VS generators; header units are not supported by CMake, and there’s no built-in import std;. We therefore keep HUs compiler-driven and enable named-module stubs only where the environment qualifies. CMake
