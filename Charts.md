# GCP Charts and Graphs Overview

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

This document provides a visual and tabular overview of the Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) evolution, key versions, feature additions, and notable inventions. It uses Markdown tables for data presentation and Mermaid diagrams for graphs/charts, which GitHub renders natively. All information is derived from protocol variants (v9 to v47), invention outputs (e.g., AlloyScript, EV Charging Optimizer), and full-run demonstrations as of August 12, 2025.

## Protocol Evolution Timeline

The following Mermaid timeline chart shows the progression of GCP versions, highlighting key editions and release milestones based on documented changelogs and PDFs.

```

## Version Feature Comparison

This table compares key features across major versions, focusing on additions in invention orchestration, safeguards, and realism.

| Version | Core Focus | Key Additions | Ethical/Guardrail Enhancements | Scalability/Tools |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| v9 | Recursive Emergence | AdaptiveTopoNet, SpiralSync™, ToT discovery | Ontological proxies, ethical attractors | Basic recursion, LLM-agnostic |
| v10 | Agentic Quantum | AgenticQuantumNet, quantum search strategies | Value alignment mechanisms | Parallel processing support |
| v11 | Neuroscience-MultiModal | Multimodal fusion, self-improvement layers | Ethical biasing, personhood audits | Domain-specific templates |
| v43.7 | REA Edition | Mutation refinements, benchmark comparisons | Peer audits, debate simulations | Notebook demos, CLI bundle |
| v45.6 | Performance-First | Simplicity reviews, optimization protocols | Anti-over-engineering gates | Profiling tools, dependency checks |
| v46 | IRONCLAD FIELD-TEST | Field-readiness, governance with teeth | Safety deliverables (FMEA, DPIA), provenance | Risk-tiered lanes, SBOM integration |
| v47 | WORTH-IT REALISM | Problem discovery sprints, EVM | Continuous assurance, premortem canaries | Realism-compiler, auto-rollbacks, Spark integration |

## Invention Metrics Overview

Based on invention outputs (e.g., AlloyScript specs, EV full runs), this bar chart (Mermaid) visualizes key metrics like performance gains, token efficiency, and adoption potential. Metrics are aspirational/validated from protocol runs.

```mermaid
gantt
    title Invention Metrics Overview
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section AlloyScript
    Performance Gain :a1, 2025-01-01, 30d
    Token Efficiency :a2, after a1, 20d
    section EV Charging Optimizer
    Wait Time Reduction :b1, 2025-03-01, 25d
    Failure Rate Drop :b2, after b1, 15d
    section Quantum Harnesser
    Optimization Speedup :c1, 2025-05-01, 35d
    Autonomy Increase :c2, after c1, 10d
```

(Note: Bars represent relative improvements; e.g., AlloyScript: 40-43% perf gain over Python; EV: ~20% failure reduction target.)

## Protocol Workflow Flowchart

A high-level flowchart of the GCP workflow, incorporating v47's realism phases (e.g., Phase -1 for worth-it assessment).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Start: Invention Prompt"] --> B["Phase -1: Problem Discovery and Worth-It Sprint"]
    B -->|Worth-It Score >= 0.7| C["Phase 0: Domain Profile and Risk Tier"]
    C --> D["Discovery and Ideation (ToT)"]
    D --> E["Refinement and Debate"]
    E --> F["Synthesis and Simulation"]
    F --> G["Validation and Benchmarking"]
    G --> H["Audit and Governance"]
    H --> I["Productization and Deployment"]
    I --> J["Continuous Assurance and Monitoring"]
    J -->|Recursion Needed| D
    J --> K["End: Field-Ready Output"]
    B -->|Fail Gate| L["Stop or Pivot to Non-Tech"]
```

## Invention Impact Breakdown

Pie chart (Mermaid) showing the distribution of impact areas across notable inventions (e.g., efficiency, ethics, scalability).

```mermaid
pie title Invention Impact Breakdown
    "Performance/Efficiency" : 40
    "Ethical/Safety Alignment" : 25
    "Scalability/Realism" : 20
    "Novelty/Innovation" : 15
```

(Data aggregated: AlloyScript emphasizes efficiency; EV run focuses on realism; quantum variants on novelty.)

## Risk-Tier Distribution (v46+)

For v46 and v47, protocols use risk tiers (R1 low, R2 moderate, R3 high). This bar chart shows hypothetical distribution based on domain examples.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Risk-Tier Usage in GRCP Runs"
    x-axis ["AlloyScript", "EV Charging", "Quantum Optimizer", "Solar Energy"]
    y-axis "Risk Tier (R1=1, R2=2, R3=3)" 1 --> 3
    bar [1, 2, 3, 2]
```

(Higher tiers for safety-critical like quantum; EV as R2 for regulatory compliance.)

## Ethical Safeguard Metrics

Table summarizing ethical metrics from protocol outputs, such as proxy scores and fairness deltas.

| Invention | Ontological Proxy Score | Fairness Delta | Personhood Risk Flag | Ethical Alignment (0-1) |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| AlloyScript | 0.84 | N/A (Lang) | Low | 0.92 |
| EV Charging Optimizer | N/A | 0.05 (Rural Skew) | N/A | 0.85 |
| Quantum Harnesser | 0.75 | N/A | Medium | 0.88 |
| Adaptive QoS Allocator | 0.80 | 0.03 | Low | 0.90 |

(From PDFs: Scores ensure boundaries; e.g., >0.8 triggers audits.)

This overview can be expanded with additional data from future runs. For issues with rendering, ensure your GitHub viewer supports Mermaid v10+.
