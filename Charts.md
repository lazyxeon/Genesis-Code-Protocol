# GCP Charts and Graphs Overview

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

This document provides a visual and tabular overview of the Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) evolution, key versions, feature additions, and notable inventions. It uses Markdown tables for data presentation and Mermaid diagrams for graphs/charts, which GitHub renders natively. All information is derived from protocol variants and full-run demonstrations through **V48** (as of August 14, 2025).
