## `CHANGELOG.md`

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Earlier history (v9 → v45.6D) was compiled previously and is summarized below.

> Style: “curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes per version.”  
> For full context and repo history, see README and Wiki.

---

## [V49.0] – Protocol First, Runners Optional

### Added
- **Gate Decision Card (Auto Mode)** now **prints fully before acting**: 4 options + short descriptions, AI recommendation, confidence, cost/time, and risk; logged in DECISION_LEDGER. Verbosity commands added.  
- **Runner System** (optional): **Code, Physical, Theory, OT, Mobility, LifeSci, AgMRV, FinTech**. Attaching seeds domain files and micro-gates; `attach/detach/show` runner commands.
- **Alias Resolver**: case/space-insensitive synonyms; combo aliases like `industrial-robotics` → `[OT, Mobility]`, `medical-ai` → `[Code, LifeSci]`.
- **C7.Repro micro-gate**: standard repro protocol/results/env-lock files.
- **11.3 IP & Disclosure**: explicit review for IP/export/ethics before packaging.
- **Evidence TTL defaults**: R1=180d, R2=90d, R3=30–60d (defined in `15_ce/PLAN.md`).

### Changed
- Expanded manifest conventions and ledger set; clarified artifact naming and export packaging.

### Notes
- V49 runs perfectly **without** runners; runners are **optional enhancers**.  
  (See Charts.md for visuals and Master Runner templates for file seeds.)

## [V48] – Pre-Execution Reasoning & Adversarial Rigor

### Added
- **Pre-execution**: **−0.8 TRIZ/ARIZ** and **−0.5A C-K Drift** before **−1 Worth-It**.  
- **Exploration**: **2.5 Futures & Morph Space**.  
- **Adversarial**: **4.A Red-Team**, **6.5 Multi-Agent War Game**, **13.5 Devastation**; **14.5 Adversary Shadowing** post-deploy.
- **Artifacts**: CONTRADICTION_LEDGER, C_K_LEDGER, MORPH_FUTURES_LEDGER, ADVERSARY_LEDGER.
- **Checkpoint UX**: Full Run vs Auto Mode, resumable at every gate.

---

## [V47.2] – Dual-Mode + Renumbered Flow

### Added
- **Full Run** (stop at each gate) and **Auto Mode** (conditional stops).  
- Universal checkpoint banner; graph-enhanced reasoning (optional).  
- Renumbered flow from C−0.5 Worth-It to CE (Phase 14).  
(Repo README historically reflected this version.) :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}

---

## [V47.1] – Checkpoint-Gate UX

- Deterministic branching; explicit stop/summary/options at each gate. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}

## [V47] – Worth-It Realism

- Phase −1 Worth-It Sprint + C−0.5; Minimal-Intervention principle; C6.9; forecasts/Brier. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

## [V46.5] – Continuous Assurance

- Phase 14 CE loop; risk tiers; SPDX/SAST/DAST; SemVer/compat. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

## [V46] – Field-Test Hardening

- C8.4 Simplicity before C8.5 Optimization; tightened C7. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

---

## [v45.6D and earlier] – Summary

- Agentic multimodal scaffolding; SBOM/signing intro; enterprise docs.

What I used & why (for transparency)
Pulled your current repo’s public README (shows up as V47.2 with Version Matrix) to ground historical entries. 
GitHub

Used your V48 About and V48 README source text to keep continuity while upgrading language and scope for V49. 
 

Merged V49 protocol specifics (Gate Decision Card fix, runners, aliases, C7.Repro, 11.3 IP & Disclosure, TTLs) into all docs. 

Listed runner auto-seeded templates in Charts and referenced file paths for clarity. 

If you want, I can also drop these into the exact repo paths you prefer (e.g., root README.md, About.md, Charts.md, CHANGELOG.md) and align any internal links or badges you’d like to add/remove.

all of them are great except that charts didnt work, says it failed the rich display

Thought for 1m 12s
Got you—this is almost certainly a Mermaid rendering quirk on GitHub (sequence + gantt are the usual culprits, and labels with special characters/parentheses can also break parsing unless quoted). GitHub definitely supports Mermaid, but their renderer/version sometimes lags or is picky about syntax. 
The GitHub Blog
GitHub Docs

Below is a drop-in replacement for Charts.md that:

uses only flowchart diagrams (most stable on GitHub),

quotes labels that include punctuation/symbols,

replaces the old sequence and gantt with a flowchart + a simple table.

If you paste this file as-is, it should render on GitHub.
