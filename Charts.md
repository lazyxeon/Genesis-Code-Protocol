# GCP Charts and Graphs Overview

This document provides a visual and tabular overview of the Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) evolution, key versions, feature additions, and notable inventions. It uses Markdown tables for data presentation and Mermaid diagrams for graphs/charts, which GitHub renders natively. All information is derived from protocol variants and full-run demonstrations through **V48** (as of August 14, 2025).

1) Protocol Evolution (Flow)

Caption: Evolution of GCP editions from v45.6D → V48.
Alt: Boxes with arrows showing v45.6D, V46, V46.5, V47, V47.1, V47.2, V48 and their focus areas.

Summary:
Left-to-right view of how GCP matured: from field-test hardening (V46) and continuous assurance (V46.5) to worth-it realism (V47), checkpoint UX (V47.1), dual-mode execution (V47.2), and V48’s pre-execution reasoning plus adversarial/ops hardening. The takeaway: each release tightens realism, governance, and safety without regressing core capability.

2) Version Feature Comparison (Table)

Caption: Side-by-side features and safeguards across major versions.
Alt: Table mapping versions to focus, key additions, and safeguards/realism notes.

Summary:
Quick scan of what changed, why it matters, and where safeguards grew stronger. V48 adds TRIZ/ARIZ and C-K pre-checks, Futures/Morph planning, explicit red-team and war-game phases, and a pre-release Devastation Protocol—raising the assurance bar before C9 and continuing with adversary shadowing post-deploy.

3) Invention Metrics Overview (Gantt-style)

Caption: Illustrative sequencing of work streams for sample inventions.
Alt: Horizontal bars for AlloyScript, EV optimizer, and Quantum Harnesser phases with relative durations.

Summary:
Shows relative effort/order (not strict dates) to communicate how performance, reliability, and autonomy improvements typically stack. Use it to plan staffing, estimate runway, and visualize when risk or validation spikes are likely during a run.

4) Protocol Workflow Overview (V48)

Caption: End-to-end flow of V48 with gates and adversarial phases.
Alt: Two-column flow of boxes from “Start: Spark Prompt” through −0.8/−0.5A pre-checks, Phase −1 worth-it, core build/test phases, C8.4→C8.5, C6.9, 13.5 Devastation, C9, and post-deploy CE/shadowing.

Summary:
Blueprint for how a run proceeds and where it must stop. Read top-down: pre-execution contradiction/C-K checks → worth-it → design/simulate/validate → simplicity then optimization → field realism/productization → Devastation PASS → signed release → continuous evaluation and adversary shadowing. Use it to orient new contributors and enforce gate discipline.

5) Invention Impact Breakdown (Pie)

Caption: Illustrative balance across performance, ethics/safety, scalability/realism, and novelty.
Alt: Pie with four slices: Performance/Efficiency (largest), Ethical/Safety, Scalability/Realism, Novelty/Innovation.

Summary:
Signals that GCP doesn’t chase speed alone. While performance often dominates effort, ethical/safety alignment and real-world scalability remain substantial and non-negotiable portions of the work, with novelty guided by worth-it and adoption gates.

6) Risk-Tier Mapping (Bar)

Caption: Typical risk lanes by domain (illustrative).
Alt: Bars mapping AlloyScript→R1, EV Charging→R2, Quantum Optimizer→R3, Solar→R2.

Summary:
A cheat sheet for picking R1/R2/R3 rigor. R1 suits low-impact language/runtime work; R2 adds full integrity and ops realism for user-facing services; R3 is for regulated/safety-critical domains with formal hazards, assurance cases, and HIL where applicable.

7) Ethical Safeguard Metrics (Table)

Caption: Example ethics/fairness metrics reported per invention.
Alt: Table with columns: Invention, Proxy Score, Fairness Delta, Personhood Risk Flag, Ethical Alignment.

Summary:
Shows the kind of traceable ethics telemetry GCP expects at gates: proxy alignment, fairness slice deltas, and explicit risk flags, capped with an overall alignment indicator. Use similar tables in runs to make exceptions visible and guardrails auditable.
