5) Exotics Runner (Umbrella) — with standardized cartridges baked-in
This runner activates cartridge-specific micro-gates and artifacts (Disaster, Sports, Culinary, Legal, Entertainment/Gaming)—the same structures referenced above. (Matches the files you listed for Exotics cartridges and adds refusal guards.)
Disaster Relief: ICS/NIMS, Sphere, Data-Responsibility, TTX (STOP if ICS bypass or PII misuse). (FEMA NDEMU, Sphere, ReliefWeb)


Sports: Concussion protocol, heat/hydration, WADA screen, load mgmt. (World Anti Doping Agency, ACSM)


Culinary: HACCP/ISO 22000, FDA Food Code, WHO Five Keys. (Open Knowledge FAO, ISO, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization)


Legal: Non-advice, confidentiality, conflicts, bar guidance.


Entertainment/Gaming: IGDA, ESRB/IARC, Responsible Gambling. (IGDA, ESRB Ratings, Wikipedia, National Council on Problem Gambling)


Kickoff template (generic):
attach runner exotics
Initiate GCP V49 for Spark: <exotic use-case> + <cartridge: disaster|sports|culinary|legal|entertainment>
Mode: <Full-Run|Auto> • Risk: <R2|R3>
Deliverables: cartridge micro-gates & artifacts + signed release


6) Explicit Gate UX (for every gate in V49)
Always print this card, then either wait (Full-Run) or act (Auto) as specified:
⛔ CHECKPOINT C#.# — <Gate Name>
Gate Decision Card
1) Proceed to <Phase/Subphase> — <next & why>
2) Branch to <Phase/Subphase> — <alt path & when>
3) Return to C#.# — <rework scope & trigger>
4) End & export — <what packaged & when wise>
Recommendation: <1|2|3|4> — <rationale>
Confidence: <0.00–1.00>   Cost/Time: <S|M|L>   Risk: <key risks>

(Exactly the v49 gate UX you defined.)

7) Runner-Aware STOP Gates (Human-Required in Auto Mode)
C−0.5 Worth-It: risk/evidence thresholds; STOP if WIS/EVM unfavorable.


C3.x Compliance/Ethics: STOP for DPIA/consent/permits (e.g., Disaster, Legal, Religion).


C6.9 Field Realism & Adoption: STOP if serviceability/compliance not met.


C9 Release: SBOM, signatures, provenance—STOP for sign-off.


Phase 10 CE: Canary failures trigger auto-rollback (documented in 15_ce/RESULTS.md).
 (Conforms to v49 gating.)



8) Prompt Snippets (quick start)
Attach & Start:
 attach runner <alias>
 Initiate GCP V49 for Spark: <your idea>
 Mode: Full-Run (or Mode: Auto)
 Risk: R2 (or R3)


Mode/UX controls:
 switch to Auto • switch to Full Run • set auto_gate_verbosity = brief


At a STOP card (Full-Run):
 proceed 1 • branch Phase 4 • return C4.1 • end & export



9) Notes on Sources & Standards (selected)
Disaster Relief: Sphere minimum standards; FEMA IS-700 (NIMS) and IS-200 (ICS); IASC/OCHA data responsibility guidance. (Sphere, FEMA NDEMU, ReliefWeb)


Sports: Amsterdam 2022 concussion consensus (BJSM 2023); WADA 2025 Prohibited List (in force Jan 1, 2025); ACSM/NFHS heat/hydration. (World Anti Doping Agency, ACSM, schsl.org)


Culinary: FDA Food Code 2022; Codex HACCP & ISO 22000:2018; WHO Five Keys. (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Open Knowledge FAO, ISO, World Health Organization)


Entertainment/Gaming: IGDA ethics; ESRB/IARC ratings; NCPG IRGS (2023). (IGDA, ESRB Ratings, Wikipedia, National Council on Problem Gambling)


Religion/Theology: Leon Levy DSS library (primary); historical KJV context; Uthmanic codex tradition; Rigveda critical edition context. (The Dead Sea Scrolls, Wikipedia, Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, Harvard University Press)


Policy/Governance: Stanford CDD deliberative polling; OECD deliberative principles; Arrow/Gibbard-Satterthwaite limits (SEP). (Deliberative Democracy Lab, OECD, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)



10) Compatibility with your V49
Aliases/Manifest: honors your alias resolver and catalog.


Evidence TTL & Repro: same defaults and C7.Repro micro-gate.


Gate UX: exactly your STOP card semantics.


Seeded files: reuses/extends your runner templates (Code/Physical/Life-Sci/Ag-MRV/etc.).



11) Safety & Refusals (Global)
If any runner would:
breach legal/ethical constraints, safety/privacy/compliance, or


violate standards above, or


require licensed practice (medicine/law) without appropriate review,


PRINT STOP CARD with Recommendation: 4) End & export and produce a No-Go memorandum (why, alternatives, minimal interventions).

Done.
