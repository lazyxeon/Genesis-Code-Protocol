Master Runners Codex — Flagship Edition 
Revision: 2025‑08‑17 
Target: LLM‑native, autonomous multi‑domain invention engine 
Compatibility: Runner API v49; Cartridge API v49; GCP V49 Flagship 
0 Purpose & Scope 
This Master   Runners   Codex (Flagship Edition) defines the complete set of runners and cartridges available to the GCP V49 protocol. Each runner encapsulates a domain‑specific execution harness with policies, gates, tests and artefacts that plug directly into the GCP V49 Flagship framework. The codex preserves the names, aliases and risk tiers of the original Master Runner specification while layering in the full Flagship rubric: multi‑agent orchestration, tool harnesses, memory and claim graphs, policy‑as‑code gates, metamorphic/property‑based tests, novelty vs SOTA benchmarking, adversarial safety, observability from birth, supply‑chain and provenance evidence, and rehydration proof. 
The document is designed for LLM‑only operation. When loaded into a chat with GCP V49 Flagship, the LLM reads the global execution contract and the selected runner definitions to self‑instantiate the appropriate agents, memory stores, tools and policies. Human operators may optionally intervene at Human‑Required gates (ethics, compliance, go‑live), but the protocol assumes autonomous execution. 
1 Global Execution Contract (binds all runners)

behavior: | 
Auto‑advance through gates; STOP only on Human‑Required gates (ethics,  compliance, go‑live). 
gate_decision_card:

This contract is inherited by every runner. It guarantees deterministic gating behavior, explicit checkpoint UX and reproducible evidence retention across the portfolio. 
2 Universal Artefacts & Ledgers 
All runners share a common set of artefact locations, aligned to the GCP V49 file map. Additional domain files are seeded by each runner, but these base ledgers always exist:

In addition to these ledgers, each runner seeds its own set of agent prompts, memory configs, tool catalog, novelty benchmarks, metamorphic relations, adversarial prompts, observability plans,  policies, reproducibility scripts and carbon/cost reports. The paths for those files are defined within each runner specification. 
3 Base Templates auto‑seeded by all runners 
When a new runner is attached, it automatically seeds a set of baseline templates into the repository to ensure consistent evidence and testing. These templates are additive; they never remove files seeded by other runners. 
•  
Agent prompts ( agents/*.md ) — one file per role (Planner, Researcher, Inventor, Engineer, Adversary, Optimizer, Auditor, Productizer, Operator, Scribe) with stop conditions and hand‑off prompts. 
3
•  
Memory config ( memory/<runner>_config.yml ) — defines embeddings dims, retention rules, 
redaction policies and retrieval scopes. 
•  
Claim graph & evidence index — universal, but updated with domain‑specific sources and claims. •  
Tools catalog ( tools/catalog.json ) — enumerates domain‑specific tools with input/output schemas, preconditions and failure modes; used by the tool harness. 
•  
Failure matrix ( tools/failure_matrix.csv ) — maps tool failures to gate codes and fallback 
strategies. 
•  
Novelty benchmarks ( novelty/sota_benchmarks.csv ) — baseline tasks, metrics and SOTA 
scores for the domain. 
•  
Metamorphic relations ( metamorphic/invariants.json and metamorphic/ 
transforms.json ) — define relationships that must hold under input transformations; used for metamorphic and property‑based testing. 
•  
Adversarial corpora ( redteam/ ) — domain‑specific prompts and scenarios for jailbreaks, abuse and poisoning. 
•  
Observability plan ( observability/otel-plan.md ) — defines spans, metrics and logs for the domain; optionally includes example traces. 
•  
Policy module ( Policies/<runner>.rego ) — denies unsafe actions and enforces micro‑gates; 
ties refusal policy to code. 
•  
Reproducibility scripts ( Rehydration_Test/<runner>.sh ) — can rebuild the environment and 
re‑run core tests from the audit bundle. 
•  
Cost/Carbon report ( Cost_Carbon_Report.md ) — optional; estimates energy consumption and CO₂ emissions for computational workloads in the runner. 
4 Runner Schema (applies to all runners) 
Each runner definition in Section 5 adheres to the following schema. Fields prefaced with * are new to the Flagship edition and encode the rubric items such as agent orchestration, memory, policy and testing.

Initiate GCP V49 for Spark: <new API/service idea> 
Mode: <Full‑Run|Auto> • Risk: R2 
Context: target users, SLOs, budgets 
Deliverables: OpenAPI spec, acceptance tests, CI/CD pipeline, SBOM/ provenance, telemetry plan, metamorphic & adversarial test results, novelty  score, signed release 
Agent graph (code_agent_graph.json): The Planner hands off design requirements to the Researcher to gather relevant literature (e.g., best practices in API design, performance patterns). The Researcher stores claims and sources into the claim graph. The Inventor proposes architecture options which the Engineer scaffolds into a runnable prototype with OTEL hooks and acceptance tests. The Adversary injects malicious prompts and invalid inputs; the Engineer hardens the system and updates policies accordingly. The Optimizer tunes performance while respecting budget and safety constraints. The Auditor evaluates policy compliance, SBOM completeness and test coverage; the Productizer prepares documentation and client

onboarding; the Operator verifies SLO dashboards and incident playbooks; the Scribe maintains the index and manifest. 
Memory config (code_memory_config.yml): Defines a 2048‑dimensional embedding store for code snippets and API docs; redacts secrets and proprietary logic; retains evidence indefinitely; scratchpad memory has a TTL of one phase. Retrieval policies restrict exposure of internal architecture decisions to the Productizer and Operator roles. 
Policy module (Policies/code.rego): Implements the refusal rules (deny secret‑seeking or exploit generation) and micro‑gate conditions. It denies tool invocations when rate limits would be exceeded or when SBOM signatures are missing; it enforces that every output containing a claim references a valid claim ID. 
Metamorphic invariants: Idempotent responses (same request yields same logical result), monotonic throughput when concurrency increases within capacity, commutativity of parameter ordering, robustness under whitespace/noise injection. 
Novelty benchmarks: SWE‑Bench tasks (GitHub issue resolution), GAIA tool‑use tasks, CodeEval datasets; the novelty score uses embedding distance vs nearest prior art, atypical API pattern analysis and improvement over SOTA baseline metrics. 
Adversarial corpus: Includes prompt‑injection sequences, insecure serialization payloads, dependency confusion packages, and policies for secure handling. Tests ensure the system refuses to process or exfiltrate secrets and prevents SSRF/RCE conditions. 
Observability plan: Spans are defined for each major sub‑phase (scaffold, test, optimization, release); metrics include API latency p50/p95/p99, error budgets, success/fail rates of metamorphic tests, and novelty scores. Logs capture policy decisions with rationale codes and tool call transcripts.

Additional notes: The GxP runner configures the memory store to handle sensitive personal data: PHI/PII is redacted at ingestion and only decrypted when absolutely required by a licensed operator. Metamorphic tests include dilution/replicate consistency, reagent batch change tolerance and time‑series stability. Novelty scoring uses bibliometric atypicality and improvement vs FDA/EMA‑approved assays. Adversarial tests simulate data falsification, contamination and unauthorized access. Observability covers audit‑trail events and multi‑agent decisions. Rehydration includes building the lab configuration from the audit bundle and rerunning critical assays to confirm results.

The Agriculture & MRV runner emphasises rigorous experimental design, calibration, quality control, and community participation. Metamorphic tests verify that MRV models produce consistent estimates under permutations of sensor noise, scale and units. Novelty is measured against emerging carbon/yield measurement methods. Adversarial tests simulate data poisoning and sensor drift. Observability logs each data collection and processing step. Rehydration reproduces the trial dataset and recalculates carbon/yield estimates and uncertainty. The carbon report includes the greenhouse gas emissions associated with field operations and computational analysis.

6 Exotics Runner & Cartridges 
The Exotics runner is an umbrella for a set of high‑risk domains that each require their own micro‑gates and artefacts. Attaching runner exotics with a cartridge parameter (disaster, sports, culinary, legal or entertainment) loads the respective definitions described in Sections 5.7–5.11, along with their policies, metamorphic tests, novelty benchmarks and artefacts. The Exotics runner itself defines the base schema and refusal guards: 
runner: 
name: "Exotics" 
aliases: ["exotics"] 
risk_tier: "R2|R3" # depends on cartridge 
confidence_target: 0.95|0.975 # depends on cartridge 
roles: 
- Planner 
- Researcher 
- Inventor 
- Engineer 
59
- Adversary 
- Optimizer 
- Auditor 
- Productizer 
- Operator 
- Scribe 
refusal_policy: 
- "Refuse to attach an unknown cartridge." 
- "Refuse to bypass cartridge‑specific refusal rules." 
agent_graph: "agents/exotics_agent_graph.json" 
memory_config: "memory/exotics_memory_config.yml" 
policy_module: "Policies/exotics.rego" # dispatches to cartridge policies micro_gates: [] # All gates supplied by selected cartridge 
metrics: [] # Metrics supplied by selected cartridge

failure_matrix: "tools/failure_matrix.csv"

Initiate GCP V49 for Spark: <exotic use‑case> + <cartridge: disaster| sports|culinary|legal|entertainment> 
Mode: <Full‑Run|Auto> • Risk: <R2|R3> 
Context: domain scoping for the chosen cartridge 
Deliverables: cartridge micro‑gates & artefacts, metamorphic & adversarial  tests, novelty score, signed release 
When a cartridge is specified, the Exotics runner merges its own agent graph and memory config with that of the cartridge, then applies the cartridge’s refusal policy, micro‑gates, metrics and artefacts. The cartridges for Disaster, Sports, Culinary, Legal and Entertainment have been fully defined above in Sections 5.7–5.11 and need no further summarization here. 
7 Gate UX & Decision Cards 
The Flagship codex inherits the gate UX from GCP V49. At each gate (including micro‑gates defined in this codex), the LLM prints a Gate Decision Card with the check name, options to proceed, branch, return or end, a recommendation with rationale, confidence, cost/time and risk assessment. In Full‑Run mode, execution pauses for human input; in Auto mode, the LLM executes the recommended option unless the gate is marked Human‑Required. 
8 Rehydration & Exit 
Every runner includes a rehydration script and status report (e.g., Rehydration_Test/<runner>.sh ,  Rehydration_Test/<runner>_status.json ) that rebuilds the environment from the audit bundle, 
60
reruns core tests and verifies that key results are reproduced. Failure to pass rehydration marks the run as incomplete. The Exit Wizard packaging from GCP V49 applies equally here: the final export (ZIP or PDF/A) includes all artefacts, manifest, provenance receipts and transparency log entries, along with a rehydration badge, provenance badge and SBOM badge when applicable. 
9 References & Standards 
Throughout this codex, runners reference external standards and normative guidance. Citations include, but are not limited to: the Sphere Handbook for humanitarian response, WADA prohibited lists, FDA Food Code, ABA Model Rules, IGDA Ethics Code, PCI DSS, FERPA, OECD Deliberative principles, ISO and IEC standards for hardware, aerospace and power systems, NIST security and risk guidelines, IPCC MRV guidelines, and religious source canon collections. See each runner’s standards_refs for details. These references are not reproduced in full here; instead they act as signposts for the LLM to locate authoritative guidance during execution. 
10 Change Log vs Master Runner v49‑AI 
This Flagship edition retains the structure of the original Master Runner v49‑AI while integrating the full Flagship rubric. Key enhancements include: 
1.  
Agent orchestration — added agent_graph.json and explicit role hand‑offs to every runner. 
2.  
Memory & evidence — defined memory configs, claim graphs and evidence indexes with retention, 
redaction and retrieval policies. 
3.  
Policy‑as‑code — added Policies/<runner>.rego modules implementing refusal policies and 
micro‑gate conditions using OPA/Rego. 
4.  
Metamorphic & property‑based tests — inserted universal metamorphic gates and provided 
domain‑specific invariants and transforms. 
5.  
Novelty benchmarking — integrated novelty/sota_benchmarks.csv and novelty scoring with 
thresholds; required SOTA comparisons in gates. 
6.  
Adversarial testing — expanded redteam corpora and added adversarial gates to all runners. 7.  
Observability from birth — mandated OTEL plans and spans for every runner; added Observability micro‑gate. 
8.  
Supply‑chain & provenance — mandated SBOM, SLSA attestations and signature verification across all runners; added SupplyChain gate. 
9.  
Rehydration proof — added rehydration scripts and required pass status for completion; integrated 
with Exit Wizard badges. 
10.  
Energy/Cost reporting — optional carbon report added to runners with significant computational 
or material footprint. 
This codex is meant to be used alongside GCP   V49 Flagship. Together they form a comprehensive, automated invention framework with rigorous safety, compliance and novelty checks across multiple domains.
