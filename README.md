The Genesis Recursive Code Protocol (GRCP), formerly known as Genesis Code Protocol (GCP), is an advanced, recursively-structured, AI-native invention framework. It empowers state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate, simulate, refine, and validate novel algorithms, tools, and technologies. Inspired by the human scientific method, symbolic recursion, Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning, multi-phase progression, and emerging AI paradigms like agentic quantum emergence and neuroscience-multimodal fusion, GRCP serves as a robust scaffold for AI-driven research and development (R&D). It incorporates dual-scientist refinement through simulated debates and peer audits, ontological proxies for ethical boundaries, and adaptive mechanisms for self-improvement.

GRCP is LLM-agnostic, compatible with any model supporting tool access (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok), and optimized for environments with strong reasoning capabilities. As of August 2025, the protocol has evolved to v45.6D, with significant expansions including a CLI tool, extensive variant editions, comprehensive notebooks demonstrating full invention runs, and documentation for enterprise-grade applications. The framework has produced groundbreaking inventions like AlloyScript, the world's first systematically engineered AI-native programming language.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Multi-Phase Workflow**: Iterative phases for ideation, discovery, synthesis, validation, and auditing, with recursion for deeper exploration and self-evolution.
- **Autonomous Orchestration**: Enables AI to manage the full invention lifecycle, including benchmarking against state-of-the-art (SOTA) and mutation-based refinements.
- **Dual-Scientist Simulation**: Debate and peer audit stages for rigorous critique, enhancement, and ethical alignment.
- **Ontological and Ethical Safeguards**: Proxy scores for emergence (Φ), self-reference, and personhood risks; humility prompts and boundaries grounded in 2025 AI ethics.
- **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface for streamlined execution, phase management, and automation.
- **Expanded Variants**: From v9 (Recursive Emergence) to v45.6D (latest, with advanced agentic and multimodal enhancements).
- **Notebook Demonstrations**: Full runs showcasing inventions like AlloyScript, quantum mechanics harnessers, and adaptive QoS allocators.
- **Scalability and Tools**: Supports parallel processing, quantum-inspired strategies, and integrations with libraries like Torch, SciPy, and Transformers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lazyxeon/Genesis-Recursive-Code-Protocol-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```
   cd Genesis-Recursive-Code-Protocol-
   ```
3. Install dependencies (Python 3.10+ required):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Core requirements assume LLM interpretation, but auxiliary packages (e.g., transformers>=4.30.0, torch>=2.0.0, scipy>=1.10.0, numpy>=1.23.0, pandas>=1.5.0, matplotlib>=3.6.0, jupyterlab>=3.6.0) support simulations, tools, and notebooks.

## Usage

1. Load a protocol variant (e.g., from `GRCP most recent variants/`) into your LLM.
2. Provide an invention prompt and confirm phases with `Y`.
3. For interactive runs, use Jupyter notebooks in `Notebooks/`.
4. Leverage the CLI for automated execution.

Optimal with ChatGPT; Claude and Grok yield strong results, though outputs may vary.

## CLI Tool

The CLI Bundle provides a command-line interface for running GRCP:

- **gcp_cli.py**: Main entry point for protocol orchestration.
- **phase1.py**, **phase6.7.py**: Phase-specific scripts.
- **full_run.py**: Executes complete invention cycles.
- **audit_utils.py**, **prompt_utils.py**: Utilities for auditing and prompting.

Example:
```
python gcp_cli.py --version 45.6D --prompt "Invent a novel quantum-inspired optimization tool"
```

See `CLI Bundle/CLI_Readme.md` for details.

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo.
2. Load `GCP Current Version(45.6D).md` into your AI assistant.
3. Start with: "Run GRCP v45.6D".
4. Reply `Y` to progress recursively.

Variants like v43.7 (REA Edition) are also available for specific use cases.

## Example Prompts

- "Run GRCP v45.6D and invent an AI-native programming language surpassing Python in efficiency."
- "Apply GRCP to develop a self-healing quantum-classical hybrid system."
- "Use GRCP for creating a multimodal fusion agent with ethical boundaries."

These trigger phases including ToT discovery, synthesis, validation, and ontological audits.

## How It Works

GRCP follows a structured, recursive pipeline:

1. **Initialization**: Define goal and assess intentionality.
2. **Discovery (ToT)**: Generate reasoning paths with topological gating.
3. **Refinement**: Dual-scientist debates, mutations, and SpiralSync™ for drift control.
4. **Synthesis & Simulation**: Code generation, testing, and SOTA benchmarking.
5. **Validation & Audit**: Metrics (e.g., Φ emergence, proxy scores), ethical reviews.
6. **Recursion**: Iterate until convergence or breakthrough.

Enhancements in v45.6D include agentic layers, neuroscience-inspired multimodality, and advanced proxies.
