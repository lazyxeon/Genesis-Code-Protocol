# Genesis Code Protocol (GCP)

The Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) is a recursive invention engine designed to help state-of-the-art AI systems generate, simulate, and validate novel algorithms, tools, and technologies. Inspired by human scientific method, symbolic recursion, and structured phase progression, it serves as a scaffolding for AI-led R&D.
