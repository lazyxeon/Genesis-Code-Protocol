The Genesis Recursive Code Protocol (GRCP), formerly Genesis Code Protocol (GCP), is an advanced, recursively-structured, AI-native invention framework. It empowers state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to autonomously select worthwhile problems, generate, simulate, refine, validate, and deploy novel algorithms, tools, and technologies. Inspired by the human scientific method, symbolic recursion, Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning, multi-phase progression, and emerging AI paradigms like agentic quantum emergence, neuroscience-multimodal fusion, and realism-focused governance, GRCP serves as a robust scaffold for AI-driven research and development (R&D). It incorporates dual-scientist refinement through simulated debates and peer audits, ontological proxies for ethical boundaries, adaptive self-improvement mechanisms, and now emphasizes problem worthiness, field-readiness, continuous assurance, and risk-tiered execution.

GRCP is LLM-agnostic, compatible with any model supporting tool access (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok), and optimized for environments with strong reasoning capabilities. As of August 12, 2025, the protocol has evolved to v47 (Worth-It Realism Edition), with significant expansions including problem discovery sprints, realism compilers, risk tiers, continuous operations, and full-run demonstrations like an EV charging queue prediction system. The framework has produced groundbreaking inventions such as AlloyScript and practical applications in domains like sustainable energy and transportation.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Multi-Phase Workflow**: Iterative phases for problem validation, ideation, discovery, synthesis, validation, auditing, and continuous monitoring, with recursion for deeper exploration and self-evolution.
- **Autonomous Orchestration**: Enables AI to manage the full lifecycle, including SOTA benchmarking, mutation refinements, and post-release assurance with automated rollbacks.
- **Dual-Scientist Simulation**: Debate and peer audit stages for rigorous critique, enhancement, and ethical alignment.
- **Ontological and Ethical Safeguards**: Proxy scores for emergence (Φ), self-reference, and personhood risks; humility prompts, hazard analyses, and fairness metrics grounded in 2025 AI ethics.
- **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface for streamlined execution, phase management, and automation.
- **Expanded Variants**: From v9 (Recursive Emergence) to v47 (Worth-It Realism), with new focuses on field-testing (v46), performance-first (v45.6), and realism/economics (v47).
- **Notebook Demonstrations**: Full runs showcasing inventions like AlloyScript, quantum mechanics harnessers, and EV charging optimizers.
- **Scalability and Tools**: Supports parallel processing, quantum-inspired strategies, risk-tiered lanes, and integrations with libraries like Torch, SciPy, Transformers, and Apache Spark for real-time applications.
- **Realism and Governance**: Problem "worth-it" sprints, expected-value models, non-tech alternatives, safety/privacy deliverables, SBOM/provenance, and continuous assurance with canaries and drift detection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lazyxeon/Genesis-Recursive-Code-Protocol-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```
   cd Genesis-Recursive-Code-Protocol-
   ```
3. Install dependencies (Python 3.10+ required):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Core requirements assume LLM interpretation, but auxiliary packages (e.g., transformers>=4.30.0, torch>=2.0.0, scipy>=1.10.0, numpy>=1.23.0, pandas>=1.5.0, matplotlib>=3.6.0, jupyterlab>=3.6.0) support simulations, tools, and notebooks. For v47 real-time features, Apache Spark integration is available via example notebooks.

## Usage

1. Load a protocol variant (e.g., from `GRCP most recent variants/`) into your LLM.
2. Provide an invention prompt and confirm phases with `Y`.
3. For interactive runs, use Jupyter notebooks in `Notebooks/`.
4. Leverage the CLI for automated execution, including risk-tier assignments and continuous monitoring.

Optimal with ChatGPT; Claude and Grok yield strong results, though outputs may vary.

## CLI Tool

The CLI Bundle provides a command-line interface for running GRCP:

- **gcp_cli.py**: Main entry point for protocol orchestration, now with risk-tier flags and realism checks.
- **phase1.py**, **phase6.7.py**: Phase-specific scripts.
- **full_run.py**: Executes complete invention cycles, including post-release monitoring.
- **audit_utils.py**, **prompt_utils.py**: Utilities for auditing, prompting, and governance.

Example:
```
python gcp_cli.py --version 47 --risk-tier R2 --prompt "Invent a system to optimize EV charging queues in California"
```

See `CLI Bundle/CLI_Readme.md` for details.

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo.
2. Load `GCP V47 — WORTH-IT REALISM EDITION.md` into your AI assistant.
3. Start with: "Run GRCP v47".
4. Reply `Y` to progress recursively, confirming worth-it gates.

Variants like v46 (IRONCLAD FIELD-TEST) are also available for specific use cases.

## Example Prompts

- "Run GRCP v47 and assess if inventing an EV charging queue predictor is worth it; if yes, build a field-ready system surpassing SOTA in reliability."
- "Apply GRCP v46 to develop a self-healing quantum-classical hybrid with ironclad provenance and safety assurances."
- "Use GRCP v45.6 for creating a multimodal fusion agent with performance optimizations and ethical boundaries."

These trigger phases including worth-it sprints, ToT discovery, synthesis, validation, and continuous assurance.

## How It Works

GRCP follows a structured, recursive pipeline with realism enhancements:

1. **Problem Discovery (Phase -1)**: Validate problem worthiness via charters, EVM, causal sketches, and non-tech alternatives.
2. **Initialization & Profiling**: Define domain profile, risk tiers, and budgets.
3. **Discovery (ToT)**: Generate reasoning paths with topological gating.
4. **Refinement**: Dual-scientist debates, mutations, and SpiralSync™ for drift control.
5. **Synthesis & Simulation**: Code generation, testing, and SOTA benchmarking.
6. **Validation & Audit**: Metrics (e.g., Φ emergence, proxy scores), ethical reviews, provenance checks.
7. **Productization & Operation**: APIs, runbooks, canaries, and automated rollbacks.
8. **Recursion**: Iterate until convergence or breakthrough.

v47 introduces Realism-Compiler Orchestrator (RCO) for cyclic progress and auto-actions like branching on failures.
