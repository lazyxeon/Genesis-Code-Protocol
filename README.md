# Genesis Code Protocol (GCP)

The Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) is a recursive invention engine designed to help state-of-the-art AI systems generate, simulate, and validate novel algorithms, tools, and technologies. Inspired by human scientific method, symbolic recursion, and structured phase progression, it serves as a scaffolding for AI-led R&D.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open a notebook from the `notebooks/` folder and follow the instructions to run a full protocol.# Genesis-Recursive-Code-Protocol-
A recursively-structured, AI-native invention framework, with Tree-of-Thought-based discovery and dual-scientist invention refinement.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `GCP_v43_7_REA_Edition.md`
3. Load the protocol into your AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok)
4. When prompted, reply `Y` to proceed phase-by-phase
5. ChatGPT recommended, other SOTA LLM's work great, but ChatGPT is most refined output in my experience.

## 🧪 Example Prompt

> "Run GCP v43.7 and prompt to invent a new AI-enhanced compression algorithm."

## WHILE THIS DOES AIM TO BEAT SOTA EQUIVALENTS WITH A NOVEL INVENTION/INNOVATION, THIS IS A GOAL, NOT A PROMISE
