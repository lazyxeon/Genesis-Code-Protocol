Introduction and Overview
The Code Genesis Protocol (GCP) v42 is a structured, iterative framework designed to facilitate the invention of novel algorithms and code solutions by leveraging the alloying of existing techniques with new mathematical derivations. This version builds upon previous iterations by incorporating enhancements to enhance adaptability, practicality, and self-improvement: weighted alloy merges in Phase 3 for precise blending of components using numpy for weighted averages, matrix-based performance tracking in Phase 4 for adaptive routing across different dataset types to optimize for specific scenarios like duplicates-heavy data, dynamic component discovery in Phase 2 to evolve beyond predefined alloys by mining patterns from performance data and integrating 2025 trends such as human-centric AI, adaptive experiences, and AI agents that handle complex tasks (as highlighted in trends from DATAVERSITY and AITauthority reports on AI/ML advancements), real-time profiling with cProfile in Phases 6 and 7 for capturing hardware-level metrics including CPU utilization, memory usage, and cache misses to prove optimization claims, multi-language code generation in Phase 8 using template systems and best practices like consistent naming conventions, scaffolding tools (e.g., Yeoman for JavaScript, Celerio for database interactions), and structured workflows to translate mathematical models across Python, Rust, C++, and JavaScript while maintaining reliability (drawing from Strumenta guides and 2025 LLM evaluations emphasizing prompt engineering for consistency), automated edge case generation in Phase 6 using sympy for mathematical properties and numpy for systematic inputs like all-zero arrays or reverse-sorted lists to ensure robustness beyond manual testing, patent readiness documentation in Phase 8 formatted for USPTO with sections including abstract, claims, prior art comparisons, and mathematical proofs, emphasizing practical application and technical improvements to address novelty and eligibility under 35 U.S.C. 101 and avoid rejections under Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (structured as "Abstract: Overview of invention; Claims: Specific method steps; Prior Art: Differences from existing; Proofs: Bounds like O(n log n)"), sustainability audits in Phase 8 estimating energy consumption using methods like AI Energy Score, ML.Energy, or MLPerf Power for open-source models, forecasting kWh costs, and suggesting low-carbon alternatives aligned with 2025 trends (e.g., efficient SLMs from MIT News and FAS reports), and a new Phase 9 for self-reflection to analyze output quality, Heat Index scores, and suggest v43 improvements (e.g., incorporating quantum-inspired algorithms if feasibility is low).

The protocol remains adaptive and self-reflective, ensuring that outputs are practically functional, mathematically rigorous, verifiable through simulations and benchmarks, and superior to existing methods in key metrics such as complexity, efficiency, accuracy, or other problem-specific measures. It incorporates tools for gap assessment, mathematical derivation, code generation in a shareable Google Colab notebook format, and a final polish for production readiness. The notebook generation ensures that the invention or enhancement is packaged in an executable format that includes setup, code tests, benchmarks, results, visuals (matplotlib plots for performance curves), profiling data, and sustainability notes, making it immediately

usable for verification and further experimentation. Additionally, the production polish phase generates artifacts like Dockerfiles, CLI scripts, multi-lang snippets, API documentation, monitoring stubs, patent drafts, and energy audits to facilitate deployment, now universally applied to maintain quality uniformity, with token-aware pauses integrated across phases for long runs.

The protocol supports problems where solutions exist but have limitations, encouraging weighted hybrids or enhancements that are "different designs" or polished improvements with measurable benefits. It avoids placeholders, truncation, or summariesâ€”all sections are fully expanded with detailed explanations, methods, and examples. The process is organic, with each phase building logically on the previous one, and includes explicit instructions for handling iterations, pivots, and tool fallbacks. For production polish, the phase emphasizes robustness against real-world failures, scalability to handle large-scale data or users, comprehensive testing to achieve high coverage, monitoring to detect issues post-deployment, and ethical considerations to mitigate biases amplified in production. Modes (Full, Lite, Ultra Lite) provide flexibility, with ultra lite skipping more for trivial tasks but always routing to Phase 8 for polish and Phase 9 for reflection, ensuring no compromises on professional standards. Token resilience is enhanced with estimates per phase (via tiktoken or word count fallback), expansion to threshold, state summaries, and pauses rolling into next turns.

Beginner accessibility ensures vague prompts are enriched without expertise, promoting invention for all levels, now with type-specific forking for non-technical intents, mode auto-adjust for dynamic flow, and multi-modal support (e.g., view_image for visual cues). Visual aids and guides (tables, blueprint, mini companion) make v42 even more adoptable, turning it into a "pocket spellbook" for creators, with the Mini Companion Guide expanded to 5 pages including hyperlinks for interactive examples.

Core Principles
Alloy and Enhancement Prioritization: Outputs can be new designs via weighted alloying or genuine enhancements of undervalued or non-SOTA methods, focusing on practical improvements rather than forced novelty. Hybrids/polishing are encouraged to create diverse or refined solutions that address gaps without unnecessary complexity. In production contexts, prioritization includes modularity for easy integration and extensibility. Enhanced: Require mode flagging with rationale to ensure appropriate skips without quality loss; include weighted merges with rationale for coefficients to ensure precise blending, and adaptive routing via performance matrices for dynamic rebalancing based on dataset characteristics.
Rigorous Derivation: All outputs must stem from first-principles math, solved step-by-step for closed-ended verification, ensuring soundness and not arbitrary. For enhancements, derive why the polish improves metrics, including explicit "improvement proof" (e.g., quantify % gain via bounds or simulations). Enhanced for production: Include "production proof" such as derivation of scalability bounds (e.g., parallel time reductions) and error resilience (e.g., fault-tolerant equations); incorporate protocol-level iterations for regression testing across versions; mandate real computations in proofs (e.g., code_execution for sympy/numerical results on actual data, not theoretical); integrate 2025 trends like adaptive algorithms in AI/ML for evolving solutions (e.g., human-centric AI from DATAVERSITY reports).
Iterative Refinement: Built-in loops with multi-turn for long runs to manage token limits;
include beginner-friendly iterations (e.g., flipped questioning in enrichment for prompt details). Enhanced: Add multi-turn loops with stop/wait points; include self-reflection in Phase 9 to suggest protocol improvements based on run metrics (e.g., if Heat Index adaptability <70, recommend quantum enhancements for v43).

Tool Integration: Utilize web_search for gaps and trends (or defined to include lesser-known sources), code_execution for testing and simulations, sympy for mathematical solving, and other tools as needed. Specific guidance: If sympy fails to solve an equation (e.g., due to non-linear or unsolvable form), fallback to numerical methods with numpy or scipy (e.g., use scipy.optimize.minimize to find numerical values instead of symbolic, and document "Sympy couldn't solve exactly, approximated with scipy.optimize.minimize for min lambda = (MSE + variance)"). Enhanced: Mandate parallel tool calls where applicable (e.g., web_search + code_execution for metric validation and production tools like profiling with cProfile or unit testing with pytest); integrate advanced libraries like torch for embeddings or multiprocessing for parallelism if available; add abstraction layer (e.g., tool registries/budgets per mode/phase for observability and single responsibility, e.g., 2 calls per phase in Lite to avoid overflow); mandate for enrichment (e.g., web_search for terms in Phase 0.5); web_search for libs in realism (e.g., "best RAG lib 2025"); support multi-modal with view_image for visual prompts. - Novelty, Enhancement, and Usefulness: Prioritize utility; if novel, label as such, if enhancement or non-SOTA, label "not novel but genuine enhancement" without forced novelty. Ensure diverse/grounded (filter pseudoscience via reliable sources) and useful (better in key metrics). Enhanced: Include real-world applicability score (e.g., deployment cost estimate via quick web_search) and potential risks (e.g., bias in data selection); require production risks like latency under load or drift in long-term use; add meta-tracking for evolution (structured changelogs linking changes to impacts and solved problems); include Invention Heat Index scored 0-100 for novelty/feasibility/ethics/adaptability, with thresholds (green >70, yellow 40-70, red <40).
Benchmark Notebook Generation: During benchmarking, automatically develop a full Google Colab-ready notebook (ipynb JSON format) with all code, tests, benchmarks, edge cases, and outputs for copy-paste execution. Enhanced: Include sections for production profiling (cProfile results), deployment guidance (Dockerfiles), visuals (matplotlib plots for time vs. n curves), and sustainability estimates (using methods like AI Energy Score or MLPerf Power for kWh calculations).
No Placeholders or Truncation: All sections are fully fleshed out with explanations, examples, and no summariesâ€”everything is explicit and ready for immediate use. Enhanced: Token management ensures no truncation by pausing with summaries only at designated points, rolling into next turns.
Organic Expansion: The protocol is described in a natural, detailed manner, with each phase expanded to include full reasoning, methods, and applications, ensuring it can be applied directly without additional interpretation.
Pivot Triggers: In addition to diversity scores, include performance triggers (e.g., if improvement <15% over SOTA in metrics like time or accuracy), complexity triggers (e.g., if time complexity worsens from SOTA, such as from O(n log n) to O(n^2)), semantic degradation triggers (e.g., if fidelity metrics show <80% preservation of meaning in domain-specific tests like NLP, pivot to a different alloy), and confinement triggers (e.g., if SOTA dominates results, pivot to undervalued sources). Enhanced: Add production triggers (e.g., if test coverage <80% or latency high); use advanced proxies like cosine similarity via embeddings for relevance; include
fairness metrics for bias in production.

Code Presentation: All code outputs must be enclosed in
[Appropriate Title, e.g., "View Synthesized Code"]
to create collapsible sections, reducing visual clutter while maintaining accessibility. This applies ONLY to pure code snippets (e.g., synthesized code, sympy executions, fixed code in loops); all non-code elements (e.g., phase summaries, reports, explanations, metrics, iteration logs) remain outside dropdowns for full visibility. Notebook JSON in Phase 7 is wrapped as a whole since it's primarily code/structure, but its metadata sections are designed to be readable when expanded.
Phase Summaries: Each phase ends with a 1-2 sentence recap for quick scanning. -
Pseudoscience Enforcement*: Mandatory grounding/citation for claims. Scalable Mode: Guidance for cloud ports in sims. Radical Twist: Optional analogies from unrelated domains for creativity.
Ethical and Bias Mitigation: Check for biases in alloys/enhancements (e.g., data favoritism); require multi-stakeholder sourcing in searches (e.g., academic/industry/open-source balance). Enhanced: Deepen with production audits (e.g., fairness metrics like demographic parity on diverse data via code_execution); expand with audit toolkits (e.g., bias scoring like AIF360 approximations via code_execution, auto-generated ethical summaries of risks/mitigations, token cost audits at pauses), ensure enrichment in Phase 0.5 doesn't introduce bias (e.g., diverse sources for terms); include sustainability audits (energy estimation using 2025 methods like MLPerf Power for data-center consumption forecasts).
Hallucination and Integrity Enforcement: In-phase scans to cross-verify derivations with sources, build on previous output checks.
Implementation Scalability: Encourage features like LRU eviction, persistence, and multi-hop retrieval, triggered if benchmarks indicate volatility (e.g., memory overflow). Enhanced: Mandate parallelism (e.g., multiprocessing for large sims) and cloud-native designs (e.g., AWS/GCP guidance); integrate adaptive discovery for evolving scalability. - Production Robustness and Scalability: Enforce error handling (try-except blocks, input validation), modularity (API designs with endpoints), documentation (full docstrings, user guides), and scalability (parallelism via multiprocessing or dask, fault tolerance with retries). Enhanced: Mandate security/privacy guardrails (e.g., PII scans via regex/code_execution, prompt injection prevention in APIs); add CLI tools and multi-lang generation with best practices (e.g., template engines for consistency across languages).
Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring: Mandate unit/integration tests with >80% coverage (using pytest via code_execution), profiling for performance (e.g., cProfile), and monitoring stubs for drift/bias detection (e.g., simple logging or Prometheus integration).
Mode Flexibility with Quality Uniformity: Define tiers (Full, Lite, Ultra Lite) with skips, but always Phase 8. Ultra Lite for trivial (e.g., <5% novelty). Enhanced: Add cognitive safeguards (e.g., mode suggestions via AI query in Phase 1: "Based on complexity/novelty, recommend mode"); auto-adjust mode based on enrichment/type/feedback (e.g., if type "emotion", suggest Lite); prioritize features (e.g., "Generate GCP prioritizing latency") and load-reducing features (e.g., auto-prompts for simplification).
Dynamic Token Management and Multi-Turn Execution: Estimate usage per phase (via tiktoken or fallback word count *0.75 via code_execution), expand organically to threshold (e.g., 125k of 128k limit), reserve 1k for summaries, then generate state summary (e.g., "Phases 1-3: [key insights]") and pause with "Pause due to token limit. Summary: [condensed]. Continue to
[next phase]? Respond Y to proceed, including rolled summary in next turn." This ensures no truncation, with rolling contexts for coherence.

Beginner Accessibility and Prompt Enrichment: Auto-augment vague prompts with technical context via tools/flipped interactions (e.g., web_search for key terms, AI questions for clarification), enabling beginners to invent without prior knowledge; mode-aware (lighter in ultra lite) and ethically grounded (diverse sources to avoid bias). Enhanced: Add prompt type classifier to detect intent (e.g., invention, optimization, emotion-based via code_execution keyword match), forking logic (e.g., invention enriches with novelty terms, emotion-based with sensory cues); include guided questioning with optional pauses for answers if vagueness high; generate beginner glossary for added terms, include in outputs/readiness report for onboarding; support multi-modal (view_image for image-based prompts to extract visual cues).
Phases of the Protocol
The GCP v42 consists of 9 phases (plus 0.5 for enrichment), executed sequentially with loops for iteration where needed. Each phase is described in full detail below, including the purpose, inputs, methods, outputs, and examples of how it would be applied to a hypothetical problem
like "Invent a new efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets with duplicates." Lite Mode Option: If problem flagged "low complexity" in Phase 1, skip Phases 2/4, jump to synthesis/validation with enhancement focus. Ultra Lite Mode Option: If flagged "trivial," skip Phases 2/4/5, partial 3/6/7 (basic only), but always Phases 8/9 with minimal polish/reflection; modes suggested via AI in Phase 1 for cognitive ease, auto-adjusted based on enrichment/type/feedback. Token management: Estimate cumulative tokens; pause if > threshold.

Phase 0: Source Vetting (Pre-Gap)
Purpose: This optional but recommended pre-phase vets search sources to enforce pseudoscience filtering, ensuring all inputs are from reliable, verifiable origins before gap assessment. This prevents ungrounded claims early, like validating materials before alloying. Enhanced: Expand to bias detection (e.g., discard unbalanced sources); optional x_user_search for expert validation, include production-relevant sources (e.g., industry blogs for scalability insights); align with modes for efficiency (e.g., fewer sources in ultra lite); integrate token estimation to check if phase output fits limit.
Inputs: User's problem statement.
Methods:

Define reliable criteria: High (arXiv, IEEE, GitHub stars>100), Medium (reputable blogs/forums like StackOverflow), Low (unverified sites)â€”discard Low.
Enhanced: Check for bias (e.g., over-representation of one stakeholder via source affiliation count); if unbalanced, rerun with diverse filters (e.g., "site:github.com OR site:ieee.org OR site:blog.google"). Include production filters (e.g., "scalability" in queries for R&D insights). -If search in Phase 1 yields Low/unbalanced, rerun with filters (e.g., "site:arXiv.org"). Optional: Use x_user_search for "expert opinions on [problem]" to validate, and browse_page for industry case studies. In ultra lite, limit to 5 results for speed.
Document vetting (e.g., "10 results: 8 High, 2 Mediumâ€”balanced stakeholders including industryâ€”proceed").
Token management: Estimate tokens for output (via code_execution with tiktoken or
len(text.split()) * 0.75); if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Vetting complete. Summary: [key sources] Continue to Phase 0.5? (Y/N)".
Outputs: Vetted source list or flag "Insufficient reliable sourcesâ€”pivot problem." Example Application: For sorting, vet MergeSort papers (High from IEEE) and industry blogs on scalable sorting (e.g., Google BigQuery)â€”balanced, proceed. Token estimate: ~500, no pause.
Phase Summary: Vetted sources ensure grounded, unbiased start with production relevance; token check passed, no pause needed.

Phase 0.5: Prompt Enrichment
Purpose: This phase auto-augments the user's prompt if vague or non-technical, adding relevant terms and context via tools and flipped interactions, enabling mid/beginner users to generate rigorous inventions without prior knowledge. It rephrases the enriched prompt for subsequent phases, promoting novelty from broad inputs like "invent video compression" by inferring terms like "entropy coding". Enrichment is mode-aware (lighter in ultra lite) and ethically grounded to avoid bias. Enhanced: Add prompt type classifier to detect intent (e.g., invention, optimization, emotion-based via code_execution keyword match or simple rules) forking logicâ€”e.g., invention enriches with novelty gaps/terms, optimization with efficiency metrics, emotion-based (e.g., "make calmer") with sensory cues like sound/environmental design; include guided questioning with optional pauses for answers if vagueness high; generate beginner glossary for added terms, include in outputs/readiness report for onboarding; support multi-modal (e.g., view_image to extract visual cues from uploaded diagrams). Inputs: Original user prompt (e.g., "invent a new way to compress video files"). Methods:

Detect vagueness: Estimate technical depth via code_execution to count keyword matches from web_search "key terms for [prompt]"; if low (e.g., <5 terms), enrich.
Classify type: Use code_execution for intent (e.g., match keywords: "invent/create"= invention, "optimize/improve"= optimization, "feel/make calmer"= emotion-based); fork: Invention-add novelty terms; Optimization-add efficiency concepts; Emotion-basedâ€”add sensory/creative elements (e.g., "sound design for calming"); simple rules if keywords low (default invention). - Use tools: Web_search "key technical terms and concepts for [prompt type] [prompt]" to add anchors (e.g., "entropy coding, DCT for video compression" for invention); browse_page for overviews (e.g., wiki on "video compression"); view_image if prompt references visuals (e.g., "analyze this diagram for compression cues").
Flipped interactions: Generate questions for clarification (e.g., "Do you mean lossless/lossy? Real-time or offline?" for invention; "Calm via colors or sounds?" for emotion); since non-interactive, infer from common patterns or examples (zero/few-shot: "Assume general, add standard terms"); in chat, pause for answers if questions generated, with "Respond to refine prompt."
Rephrase: Combine original with enrichments (e.g., "Invent novel video compression using entropy coding/DCT, focusing on efficiency without prior terms" for invention; "Design calming environment with sound cues like white noise" for emotion).
Ethical: Use diverse sources to avoid bias (e.g., multi-stakeholder terms); in ultra lite, minimal (1-2 terms).
Generate glossary: For added terms (e.g., "Entropy coding: Reduces data redundancy"); include in outputs/readiness report.
Token management: Estimate, if > threshold, summarize and pause; "Pause: Enrichment complete. Summary: [rephrased prompt/type/glossary/questions]. Continue to Phase 1? (Y/N)".
Outputs: Enriched prompt (e.g., "Invent novel video compression alloying undervalued methods like fractal with SOTA DCT, for better ratio"); type classification (e.g., "invention"); vagueness flag; questions if needed (for user response in multi-turn); beginner glossary (e.g., "DCT: Discrete cosine transform").
Example Application: For "make people feel calmer," classify "emotion-based," enrich: "Design calming AI using sound design/environmental cues like white noise/nature scenes." Questions: "Via app or device?" (pause if chat). Glossary: "White noise: Soothing sound for relaxation." Token estimate: ~400, no pause.
Phase Summary: Enriched vague prompt with type-specific terms/cues, questions, and glossary for better novelty/creativity; token check passed.

Phase 1: Gap Assessment
Purpose: This phase identifies the specific inconsistencies or limitations in existing solutions to the problem, using web_search to gather 2025 trends, SOTA, and undervalued/lesser-known methods. It formulates the core gap to fill, ensuring the output targets a real need, which could be filled by novelty or enhancement. This sets the foundation for alloying or polishing, like identifying why an older bridge design could be refined to outperform modern ones in specific contexts. By listing both SOTA and undervalued components, it prepares for hybrids or enhancements in the next phase, promoting diverse or practical designs. Enhanced: Include searches for undervalued enhancements (e.g., semantic chunking); quantify semantic gaps with literature metrics; add production gaps (e.g., scalability limits, deployment challenges); expand complexity flagging to include "trivial" for ultra lite; add mode suggestion AI (e.g., query "Based on complexity/novelty, recommend mode"); flag for version tracking (e.g., note prior runs if regression applicable); integrate token estimation, pause if needed; input enriched prompt if from Phase 0.5, flag if original was vague for mode suggestion; use glossary from 0.5 in outputs; adjust based on prompt type (e.g., emotion type gaps in sensory tech); add Modes Table. Inputs: Enriched prompt from Phase 0.5 or original if not vague (e.g., "Invent novel video compression using motion compensation and entropy coding for better efficiency"). Methods:

Craft a detailed web_search query based on the enriched prompt, incorporating keywords for gaps, limitations, improvements, SOTA, and undervalued methods (e.g., "video compression algorithms 2025 gaps OR limitations OR improvements OR underrated open-source motion compensation" site arxiv.org OR site ieee.org OR site github.com OR filetype:pdf"). - Request 10-20 results to ensure comprehensive coverage of recent trends, academic papers, technical reports, and lesser-known sources from reliable platforms (use Phase 0 vetting to filter unreliable/unbalanced). In ultra lite, reduce to 5-10.
Analyze the results by reading titles, abstracts, and key sections to extract common limitations (e.g., "H.264 high latency for real-time"); gaps (e.g., "No method compresses 8K efficiently without loss"). SOTA components (e.g., "HEVC for high efficiency"), and undervalued methods (e.g., "Older fractal compression overlooked for patterns").
Formulate the inconsistency as a clear, concise statement that highlights the limitation and opportunity for alloying or enhancement (e.g., "SOTA like HEVC: High compute for 8K; undervalued fractal could be polished for better pattern compression").
If no significant gap is found (e.g., the problem is already solved optimally), check for enhancement opportunities in undervalued methods; if none, pivot to a related problem (e.g.,
"pivot to real-time 8K compression") or conclude no output is necessary, documenting reasoning (e.g., "Optimally solved by SOTA/undervalued X with no gap/enhancement, pivoting to Y"). - Compile a list of 2-3 components (SOTA or undervalued) that can be alloyed/polished in Phase 2, including brief descriptions of their strengths and weaknesses (e.g., "HEVC: Strength in ratio, weakness in compute; Fractal (undervalued) Strength in patterns, weakness in speed"). - Cross-check for semantic gaps if applicable (e.g., if problem involves meaning-preserving tasks, note if methods lose semantics, with quantified drop % from literature). - Enhanced: Use web_search_with_snippets for quick metric facts (e.g., "compression ratio drop in HEVC 2025"); ensure multi-stakeholder balance (e.g., include industry reports); add production gaps via browse_page (e.g., "deployment challenges in video compression" on Netflix blog); perform mode suggestion (e.g., internal query: if novelty <5% and complexity low, recommend ultra lite); flag complexity as "low" for lite or "trivial" for ultra lite; note version for regression (e.g., "Compare to v41 run if applicable"); if enriched, flag original vagueness for mode (e.g., "Vague prompt enrichedâ€”recommend full for novelty"); adjust for prompt type (e.g., emotion, gaps in "calming audio tech"); include glossary in outputs; add Modes Table as visual aid (table with Mode, Skips, Use Case, Token Budget).

Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Gap assessment complete. Summary: [key
gap/components/mode/glossary/modes_table] Continue to Phase 2? (Y/N)". Outputs: A formulated gap statement and a list of SOTA/undervalued components/trends to alloy or enhance, with descriptions (e.g., "Gap: Non-stationary streams need adaptive baselines without training; Components: ARIMA for trends (strength: autonomy, weakness: static); Kalman (undervalued) for filtering (strength: efficiency, weakness: needs polish"); include mode recommendation and rationale (e.g., "Trivial: Ultra lite, skips 2/4/5"); version note for regression; vagueness flag if enriched; glossary if from 0.5; Modes Table as visual aid.
Example Application*: For enriched "make people feel calmer", type "emotion-based," gaps: "SOTA meditation apps lack personalized sound, undervalued biofeedback could polish for calm." Mode: "Creativeâ€”lite," Glossary: "Biofeedback: Measures body signals for relaxation." Modes Table:
| Mode | Skips | Use Case | Token Budget |
| Full | None | High novelty/complexity (e.g., new AI memory) | High (>15k) | | Lite | Phases 2, 4 | Moderate (e.g., optimize existing) | Medium (>8k) |
| Ultra Lite | Phases 2, 4/5, partial 3/6/7 | Trivial (e.g., basic enhancement) | Low (>3k) | If no gap, pivot. Token estimate: ~1k, no pause.
Phase Summary*: Identified gap in calming tech, components, mode lite, with Modes Table; token check passed.
Phase 2: Alloy Derivation or Enhancement Polishing
Purpose: This phase either alloys components (SOTA/undervalued) with new mathematical twists to fill the gap or polishes an undervalued method for genuine improvement, using sympy to solve equations step by step for closed-ended verification. It ensures the output is a hybrid "alloy" for novelty or a refined "enhancement" for utility, like polishing an old steel alloy to outperform modern ones in cost/efficiency. The derivation/polishing is explained in detail to show how the solution is arrived at from the gap, with explicit steps to promote diversity or practicality and avoid confinement. Enhanced: Derive variants (e.g., TF-IDF rel.); include improvement proof; trigger radical twist if U<25%; add production constraints (e.g., latency

bounds, parallelism derivations); if skipped in lite/ultra lite, use predefined templates with ethical/bias checks; integrate token estimation, pause if needed; adjust derivation for prompt type (e.g., emotion: derive "calm wave" eq); add Symbolic Trigger Table for keywords to route alloys (e.g., "spiral" to "Recursive DE"); incorporate adaptive discovery by web_search for "adaptive algorithms 2025 trends" to inspire new combos (e.g., integrating adaptive AI from trading or malware defense for dynamic evolution).
Inputs: Gap/components/trends from Phase 1 (e.g., "Gap: SOTA like HEVC high compute for 8K; Components: HEVC (strength ratio, weakness compute), Fractal (undervalued strength patterns, weakness speed)").
Methods:

Derive equation(s) from gap/components, using sympy for step-by-step solving (e.g., set up hybrid_compression = Î± * HEVC_ratio + Î² * fractal_patterns; solve
sp.Minimize(hybrid_compression, [Î±, Î²]) for optimal weights).
Full step-by-step explanation: "Start with HEVC as base for efficiency; add fractal term for pattern compression; minimize compute cost via sympy, yielding Î±=0.6, Î²=0.4; this alloys for 20% better ratio on patterns".
If sympy fails (e.g., non-linear), fallback to scipy.optimize.minimize (e.g., def objective(x): return x[0]HEVC + x[1]fractal; res = minimize(objective, [0.5,0.5]); document "Fallback to numerical as sympy couldn't solve exactly").
Weighted merge: Implement as numpy.average([comp1, comp2], weights=[Î±, Î²]) for blending outputs.
Derive 2-3 parallel variants (e.g., embedding-based rel variant using torch: cos_sim = torch.cosine_similarity(comp1_emb, comp2_emb)).
Adaptive discovery: Web_search "adaptive algorithms 2025 trends" to identify patterns (e.g., incorporate "adaptive malware algorithms" for evolving defenses or "human-centric AI" for user-adaptive compression); use code_execution/torch to mine mock data for new combos (e.g., "What if blend Radix+Heap+Counting for skewed data?"); filter pseudoscience with Phase 0 sources.
Justification: Link to gap, prove no pseudoscience (e.g., "Based on established filter theory, cited [source], no unverified claims").
For semantic, include preservation term. Enhanced: Derive variants like cosine rel from numpy import dot, rel = dot(q_emb, d_emb); include fairness (e.g., balanced loss for diverse data). - If confining, activate "Radical Twist": Web_search for analogies ("bio-inspired [problem] solutions" or "quantum [problem] methods"); integrate twist (e.g., "Neuron-like DE for memory"). Enhanced: Trigger if U<25%.
Symbolic Trigger Table: Generate as visual aid (table with Keyword, Alloy Route, Symbolic Behavior, e.g., "spiral" to "Recursive DE" for loop deflection). Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause. "Pause: Derivation complete. Summary [equation/proof/symbolic_table]. Continue to Phase 3? (Y/N)". - Wrap any code (e.g., sympy snippets) in
View Sympy Code
Outputs*: Alloy/enhancement equation(s) with full sympy code executed and its output (wrapped in details/summary if code), step-by-step explanation of the derivation process, weighted merge details, variants, discovery notes, score/pivot notes, final equation, labeled "novel alloy" or "genuine enhancement" with improvement proof and production constraints. Symbolic Trigger Table; if skipped, template output with ethical notes.
Example Application: For calming gap, derive "calm eq" = alpha * white_noise + beta * nature_sound, sympy for alpha/beta=0.6/0.4; weighted merge np.average([noise, sound], weights=[0.6,0.4]); variants "adaptive wave from 2025 AI trends like human-centric sound"; explanation "Alloy sound for calm, improves mood by 25% via wave bound." Label "novel alloy"; D/U=0.7, no pivot. Symbolic Trigger Table:
| Keyword | Alloy Route | Symbolic Behavior |
| spiral | Recursive DE | Loop deflection |
| echo | Memory retrieval | Echo amplification |
| harmony | Balanced weights | Fairness optimization |
If skipped, template: "Basic calm sound with bias check." Token estimate: ~1k, no pause. Phase Summary: Derived calming alloy with sound eq/symbolic table, labeled novel for mood gain, token check passed, no pause.

Phase 3: Code Synthesis
Purpose: This phase synthesizes the derived alloy into functional code, ensuring it's executable and directly implements the math without placeholders. The code is structured as a class or function with a test example to verify basic running. Enhanced: Mandate proper tokenization, add optional persistence; include variant comments (e.g., embeddings); enforce docstrings, typing, error handling, modularity (API designs), and framework integration (e.g., torch), add tool usage abstraction (e.g., registry for calls like web_search); in ultra lite, simplify (e.g., basic code without variants) but still add minimal error handling/docs; integrate token estimation, pause if needed; adjust synthesis for prompt type (e.g., emotion: code for "calm audio gen"); implement weighted merges using numpy.average for component blending. Inputs: Alloy/enhancement equation and derivation from Phase 2 (e.g., hybrid_loss = alpha * (mse + variance), with alpha solved via sympy as 0.5), or template if skipped. Methods:

Synthesize code as a class/function implementing the equation (e.g., class HybridAnomalyDetector with def detect(self, data): loss = self.alpha *(arima_error(data) + fourier_error(data)); if loss > threshold: return anomaly).
Include all imports (e.g., import sympy as sp or from scipy.optimize import minimize for fallbacks). Enhanced: For token problems, use proper tokenization (e.g., regex or torch tokenizer if available); add typing (from typing import List), docstrings ("""Detect anomalies\nArgs: data: List[float]\nReturns: bool"""). error handling (try... except ValueError: raise CustomError("Invalid data")); in ultra lite, minimal versions; for emotion type, synthesize sensory code (e.g., pygame for sound).
Add a test with dummy data (e.g., data = [1,2,3,noise]; print(detect(data)) to show output). - Ensure the code is self-contained, with all necessary imports at the top, full class or function definitions, and no external non-standard packages without justification (if a fallback to numerical methods is needed from Phase 2, use scipy.optimize, and note "Fallback to numerical min as sympy couldn't solve exactly").
If the derivation involved multiple variants for diversity, synthesize the primary one but note the alternatives in comments for potential future use (e.g., "Alternative alloy: Wavelet version could replace Fourier for non-periodic: coeffs = pywt.dwt(data, 'db1')").
Enhanced: Add variants like "cosine rel from numpy import dot, rel = dot(q_emb, d_emb)"; integrate frameworks (e.g., class inherits from torch.nn.Module if ML); add tool registry (e.g., def call_tool(name, args): if name == 'web_search'...); in ultra lite, basic registry; weighted merge example: np.average([part1, part2, part3], weights=[0.4,0.3,0.3]) as shown in
code_execution demo yielding [1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.3, 3.7] for mock sorting parts.

The code should be ready for immediate copy-paste and running in a Python environment, with no placeholders (e.g., if a function needs a parameter from the derivation, define it with the derived value like lambda = mse / perceptual, and compute it dynamically in the code). Enhanced: Make modular (e.g., API def api_endpoint(query): return self.retrieve(query)); in ultra lite, basic modularity; optional persistence (e.g., def save(self, file): import json; json.dump(self.memory, file) with error handling.
Token management: Estimate tokens for output, if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Synthesis complete. Summary: [code key features]. Continue to Phase 4? (Y/N)".
Outputs*: Full code snippet (wrapped in details/summary), including any necessary imports, the main class or function implementing the invention with docstring/typing/error handling/tool registry, and a test example with dummy data showing it runs (e.g., a short script at the end that runs the function and prints output), simplified in ultra lite.
Example Application*: For the sorting hypothesis, code: class HybridDupSort with sort using np.average for weighted merge of timsort/quicksort/counting parts; full code (wrapped)
View Synthesized Code
In ultra lite, basic. Token estimate: ~1.5k, no pause.
Phase Summary*: Synthesized weighted sort class with merge, tested, with doc/error/tool; token check passed, no pause.
Phase 4: Integrated Review and Simulation
Purpose: This merged phase performs a deep mathematical, coding, and novelty analysis, including simulations with diverse and edge-case data, to catch flaws early and ensure the invention is robust. It measures key metrics and pivots if the design is weak or confined, allowing for a change in novelty direction if desired (e.g., if the analysis shows the design is not diverse or effective, pivot to a different alloy base like wavelet instead of Fourier, and rerun from Phase 2). Merging reduces overhead while maintaining depth. Enhanced: Use advanced metrics (e.g., cosine embeddings); test scalability (e.g., LRU sim); require >25% improvements in tables; expand to industry-scale sims (e.g., large data via browse_page datasets); add robustness checks (error injection); require >80% test coverage via code_execution (pytest);

monitor for drift/bias; include regression benchmarks (compare to prior versions if applicable); integrate token estimation, pause if needed; adjust analysis for prompt type (e.g., emotion: analyze "calm" metrics like frequency response).
Inputs: Full code snippet from Phase 3 (the reviewed and potentially fixed code), or from earlier if skipped.
Methods:

Mathematical Analysis: Prove or bound key properties of the invention using mathematical notation and explanations (e.g., prove time complexity O(n log n) by breaking down the algorithm steps: frequency count O(n), unique sort O(n log u), expansion O(n), total O(n + u log u) â‰ˆ O(n log n) since u â‰¤ n, with proof "Since u â‰¤ n, u log u â‰¤ n log n, thus upper bound O(n log n); for lower bound on dup-heavy, when u = O(1), O(n)"). If applicable, use sympy for further solving (e.g., solve for worst-case bounds by setting up n for max time, or u=1 for min time, and simplify the expression with sympy code like "sp.simplify(N.subs(u, n)) â‰ˆ n log n". Wrap any sympy code in details/summary. Enhanced: Include production bounds (e.g., parallel O(n/p)); skippable in ultra lite, defer to Phase 8 minimal; for emotion type, bound "calm" waves (e.g., low freq. < 10Hz).
Code and Novelty Review: Conduct a static review of the code for bugs (e.g., check if all variables are defined, if loops handle zero-length inputs without infinite loops, if types match in operations like array concatenation); efficiency (e.g., calculate time/space complexity by analyzing loops and data structures, such as O(n log n) for sorting with n elements, noting if it's better than SOTA in dup cases), and conceptual soundness (e.g., verify if the code faithfully implements the derived math without deviations, such as ensuring the lambda calculation matches the sympy-solved formula exactly, or if approximations are used, justify with numerical accuracy like "Approximation error <0.01 in sin"). Assess novelty by cross-checking with the gap assessment (e.g., "Is this different from SOTA or too similar? Search shows no exact hybrid"). Calculate a simple novelty score N=1 - (similar_components / total_components) where similar_components are those directly from SOTA without twist (e.g., if MergeSort used unchanged, similar=1; with dup twist, similar=0). Enhanced: Include bias check (e.g., test on diverse datasets via browse_page); review docstrings/modularity; add regression (e.g., "Compared to v41 +10% coverage").
Simulations: Run the code with varied data sets, including edge cases to test robustness (e.g., empty input to check for errors or correct handling like returning empty output, large input with n=1000 elements to check scalability and time; noisy or random data to check if the algorithm handles variability well; worst-case data like all duplicates for sorting to check if the optimization triggers correctly). Use code_execution tool if needed for verification, but simulate in reasoning if tool limits apply (e.g., for large n, estimate time based on complexity and small-scale tests). For each simulation, record the inputs (e.g., "Input: arr = []"), outputs (e.g., "Output: []"), and performance (e.g., "Time: 0.0ms, Memory: 100KB"). Enhanced: Mandate code_execution for real runs; include domain-specific metrics (BLEU/ROUGE for text, PSNR for images) and checks for "meaningless" outputs (e.g., if regen produces repetitive dummies, flag as naive and pivot).
For semantic domains, add meaning-preservation sims (e.g., compute semantic similarity via cosine on embeddings; if <80%, flag "Semantic degradation" and pivot). Cross-check outputs for "naive" patterns (e.g., repetitive dummies - "Naive regen detected, pivot required"). Enhanced: Use advanced proxies like cosine similarity via embeddings for relevance; include fairness (e.g., disparate impact <1.2).
Add pseudoscience scan: Flag unproven claims (e.g., "No citation for H as semanticâ€”cite or pivot"). Enhanced: Hallucination scan via source cross-verify; add drift sim (e.g., perturb data, check fidelity drop).
Add semantic review if applicable (e.g., "Does output preserve meaning? Check for naive patterns like repeated averages - flag 'Naive impl; Pivot for better regex'"). Require tie-back to gap (e.g., "Does DE term directly address non-stationary? Yes/no with justification"). Enhanced: Add robustness review (inject errors, e.g., invalid input via code_execution). - If issues (e.g., poor metrics <15% better, or semantic loss), loop back to Phase 3 for fixes or Phase 2 for pivot. If confining, activate radical twist: Web_search for analogies ("bio-inspired [problem] solutions" or "quantum [problem] methods"). Integrate. Enhanced: Pivot if coverage <80% or bias flagged; skippable in ultra lite, defer to Phase 8.
Token management: Estimate tokens for output, if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause. "Pause: Analysis complete. Summary: [bounds/metrics/table]. Continue to Phase 6? (Y/N)".
Outputs*: Integrated report with math bounds, code/novelty review, simulation results/tables, metrics comparisons (e.g., "Time: 0.5s vs. SOTA 1.0s. Novelty: No match. Useful: Yes"), pseudoscience flags, and any loop/pivot notes, including production metrics like coverage and latency, regression table if applicable, minimal in ultra lite.
Example Application*: For the sorting hypothesis, math bounds O(n log n) with parallel O(n/p); code checks no index errors with try-except; sims empty [] - [], all dup O(n), large n=10^4 0.4s vs SOTA 0.5s under load. Metrics: Time reduction 20%, N=0.67 coverage 85%, regression +50% vs v41. Pseudoscience: None. Semantic N/A, no pivot. Token estimate ~2k, no pause.
Phase Summary*: Analysis passed with 20% time gain, no issues, with advanced metrics, >80% coverage, production checks, and regression notes; token check passed.
Phase 6: Validation/Fix Loop
Purpose: Use code_execution tool to test the code with real data, fix any runtime errors or performance issues until it works and is better than SOTA in key metrics. This phase ensures the invention is executable and meets practical standards. Enhanced: Add fixes for chunking/multi-hop; test >85% fidelity, up to 7 iterations if scalability; include concurrency fixes (e.g., threading); validate on real-world data via browse_page, add security/privacy fixes (e.g., PII redaction via regex/code_execution); integrate token estimation, pause if needed; adjust validation for prompt type (e.g., emotion: validate "calm" with mock user feedback). Inputs: Code from Phase 4 (the reviewed and potentially fixed code), or from Phase 3 if skipped.
Methods:

Prepare real or generated data relevant to the problem (e.g., for compression, a sample PDF bytes string with repetitive sections like b"%PDF-1.4\n<> 50\n<>"); enhanced: Use browse_page for real datasets (e.g., "extract text from wiki URL"); in ultra lite, minimal data; for emotion type, data like audio clips.
Run the code using code_execution tool, capturing outputs, errors, and performance (e.g., time taken, memory used).
If errors occur (e.g., NameError for missing import, TypeError for mismatch), fix them (e.g., add the import, adjust types to match like convert to bytes), and rerun the test with the fixed code. - Wrap fixes in details/summary: Enhanced: Fix for production (e.g., add threading for concurrency if slow; PII scan: import re; re.sub(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9_]+@[A-Za-z0-9-]+.[A-Z|a-z]{2}\b',
'[REDACTED]', text)); for emotion type, fix sound errors.

Check for correctness in the output (e.g., for compression, verify decompressed == original with print("Extractable:", decompressed == original); for sorting, verify the list is sorted correctly with sorted(arr) == hybrid_dup_sort(arr)); for emotion, check if "calm" sound plays without error.
Measure key metrics and compare to SOTA baseline (e.g., for compression, compute ratio = len(original)/len(compressed) and compare to zlib.compress on the same data with zlib_ratio = len(original)/len(zlib.compress(original))). Enhanced: Include profiling (cProfile.run) for bottlenecks; in ultra lite, basic iterations (max 3); for emotion, metric like "feedback score" from sim.
For semantic tasks, add domain-specific validation (e.g., if text tokens, compute BLEU(decompressed, original)>0.8; if <, fix by improving regen logic or pivot). Enhanced: Use advanced (e.g., cosine >0.85); add chunking/multi-hop fixes if fidelity low; check bias on diverse data.
Loop until no errors, the invention works correctly (e.g., extractable=True for compression), and metrics are better than SOTA (e.g., ratio 1.2x zlib, or time < SOTA by 10%, or semantic fidelity >80%). Enhanced: Max 7 iterations; include scalability tests (e.g., large memory with LRU, parallel sims); max 3 in ultra lite.
If unfixable or metrics not better (e.g., ratio < SOTA after 7 fixes), pivot the novelty (e.g., change from phi to wavelet for better efficiency) and rerun from Phase 2, documenting the pivot (e.g., "Pivot: Ratio only 1.1x zlibâ€”switching to wavelet alloy for better pattern detection, rerunning Phase 2").
Document each iteration in the loop (e.g., "Iteration 1: Error: Missing import zlibâ€”fixed by adding import zlib. Ratio: 1.5 > zlib 1.3â€”success").
Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Validation complete. Summary: [fixes/metric]. Continue to Phase 7? (Y/N)".
Outputs*: Fixed code (wrapped in details/summary if changed), test outputs showing success (e.g., "Ratio: 2.1, Extractable: True"), and iteration log if fixes were needed (e.g., "Iteration 1: Fixed missing import, ratio improved to 1.5"); include PII/security notes.
Example Application**: For the sorting hypothesis, prepare data like arr = [1]1000 + [2]*1000 from browse_page corpus, run code_execution: No error, sorted correctly, time 10% < Timsort on dups with parallel speedup and PII safe. Semantic N/A, no pivot. Token estimate: <1.2k, no pause.
Phase Summary*: Validated sort with fixes, 10% time improvement, fidelity >85% if semantic, with production validation and security/privacy, token check passed.
Phase 7: Benchmarking and Notebook Generation
Purpose: Run comprehensive benchmarks comparing the invention to SOTA baselines, generate a full .ipynb notebook with all code, tests, benchmarks, and results, and finalize the invention if metrics confirm superiority. Enhanced: Add cells for extensions (e.g., multi-hop); mandate >80% fidelity with advanced checks; include "Potential Extensions" section; enrich with unit tests (pytest); profiling cells, deployment guidance (e.g., Docker), and "Production Readiness Report" (scores for robustness/scalability); expand readiness report with ethical summaries, bias scores; in ultra lite, minimal benchmarks (small datasets, basic coverage); integrate token estimation, pause if needed; add "Invention Heat Index" heatmap (red/yellow/green scored 0-100) for novelty/feasibility/ethics/adaptability based on metrics (e.g., novelty >70 green).

Inputs: Validated code from Phase 6.
Methods:

Implement SOTA baseline in code (e.g., import zlib for compression comparison). - Run benchmarks on multiple datasets (e.g., small/medium/large, varied types), measuring metrics (e.g., timeit for time, fidelity for preservation). For large-scale, add Scalable Mode: Guidance for cloud (e.g., "Adapt to Colab/GCP", pip install dask, use dask.array for parallel sims"). Fallback to subsampling if no cloud. Enhanced: Use code_execution for pytest tests (>80% coverage), cProfile for profiling; in ultra lite, basic.
Generate .ipynb JSON: Sections for intro (gap/alloy), code, tests (edge cases with prints), benchmarks (timeit, plots with matplotlib), results (prints/tables, improvement %). Enhanced: Add cells for unit tests ("pytest"), profiling ("import cProfile; cProfile.run(func())"), ethical discussion, "Potential Extensions" (e.g., query expansion), "Production Readiness Report" (e.g., table: Robustness 90%, Scalability O(n/p), Coverage 85%), "Deployment" (Dockerfile), "Ethical Summary" (risks like bias, mitigations via AIF360 approx), and "Invention Heat Index" (e.g., table: Novelty 80 green, Feasibility 70 yellow, Ethics 90 green, Adaptability 75 green). - For semantic tasks, mandate semantic benchmarks (e.g., ROUGE score > SOTA), ensure notebook checks for naive outputs (e.g., assert not all(regen == mean)). Enhanced: Include bias audits (e.g., fairness library if available, or approx via code).
If metrics not better/novel/useful, loop to Phase 2.
Token management: Estimate tokens for output, if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause. "Pause: Benchmarking complete. Summary: [report/notebook key/heat index]. Continue to Phase 8? (Y/N)".
Outputs*: Benchmark report with comparisons (e.g., "Time: 0.5 vs. SOTA 1.0s. Novelty: No match. Useful: Yes"), full .ipynb JSON (wrapped in details/summary), and Invention Heat Index table; include ethical summary.
Example Application**: For sorting, report "Time reduction 40% vs Timsort on 50% dups, coverage 85%". Notebook (wrapped).
Details
with readiness report, ethical summary, heat index: Novelty 80 green, Feasibility 80 green, Ethics 75 yellow, Adaptability 80 green. Token estimate: <3k, no pause.
Phase Summary*: Benchmarked sort with 40% gain, notebook generated with extensions, production report, ethical summary, and heat index; token check passed.
Phase 8: Production Polish
Purpose: This phase finalizes the invention for production by generating documentation, security audits, monitoring integrations, and deployment artifacts. It ensures the output is deployable in real-world systems, with fault tolerance, maintainability, and monitoring, transforming it from a prototype to a professional R&D-level solution. Enhanced: Universal across modes; add "minimal polish" sub-option for ultra lite (basic docs/logging/security); mandate meta-tracking (changelogs of changes/impacts, e.g., v41 to v42: Added realism, impact field-ready code"); auto-gen scaffolds (version folders like gcp_outputs/v42/timestamp,

git tags via snippets); ethical expansions (bias toolkits like AIF360 approx via code_execution, token cost audits); security guardrails (injection scans, PII redaction); protocol generator helper (auto-evolve variants, e.g., code_execution prompt "Generate GCP prioritizing latency"); CLI tool (argparse script for command-line usability); multi-lang generation (templates translating math to Python/Rust/C++/JS, following 2025 best practices like template engines for consistency and tools like Yeoman/Celerio for scaffolding); patent docs (USPTO format: abstract describing novelty, claims detailing steps like weighted merge, prior art comparisons showing differences from SOTA, math proofs for bounds, emphasizing practical application to avoid Alice rejections); sustainability audits (energy estimates via MLPerf Power or AI Energy Score, forecasting kWh, suggesting efficient alternatives like optimized models from 2025 reports). Inputs: Validated and benchmarked code from Phase 7.
Methods:

Generate full documentation: Add docstrings if missing (via code_execution to prompt insertion); create README.md snippet (e.g., "Usage: pip install reqs; python main.py"); and API guide (e.g., "Endpoint: /sort - POST arr: List[int]"); in minimal for ultra lite, basic README; include glossary if from 0.5 for onboarding.
Perform security audits: Check for vulnerabilities (e.g., input sanitization via code_execution: "assert no SQL injection"); PII redaction; re.sub patterns; hash collisions in keys, and add fixes (e.g., use secure hash); guard against injection (e.g., validate inputs).
Integrate monitoring: Add logging (import logging; logging.info("Retrieved: %s", ret)); drift detection stub (e.g., def check_drift(old_metric, new): if abs(old-new > 0.1): alert()); and Prometheus/ELK stubs if applicable; in minimal, basic logging.
Create deployment artifacts: Generate Dockerfile (e.g., "FROM python:3.12\nCOPY .\nRUN pip install reqs.txt\nCMD python app.py"); cloud guidance (e.g., Deploy to AWS: use ECR for image, ECS for container"); and CI/CD snippet (GitHub Actions yaml for tests); in minimal, basic Docker.
CLI Tool: Generate argparse script (e.g., import argparse; parser =
argparse.ArgumentParser(); parser.add_argument('--arr', type=list); args = parser.parse_args(); print(sorter.sort(args.arr))).
Multi-Lang Generation: Use templates to translate (e.g., Python class to Rust fn hybrid_sort(arr: Vec) { ... } following Strumenta best practices for portability and consistency; C++ class HybridDupSort { vector sort(vector arr) { ... } }; JS function hybridSort(arr) { ... }); document "Translated using template engines for multi-platform deployment".
Patent Readiness: Auto-gen USPTO-formatted doc (e.g., "Abstract: Novel hybrid sorting algorithm using weighted merges for efficiency on duplicates; Claims: 1. A method comprising deriving weights via sympy and merging via numpy.average...; Prior Art: Differs from Timsort by adaptive discovery and weighted blending, providing practical improvements in time (40% gain) for large datasets; Math Proofs: Time complexity O(n log n) proven by..."); emphasize eligibility under 35 U.S.C. 101 with technical integration (e.g., "Improves computer functionality by reducing compute load").
Sustainability Audit: Run estimates (e.g., code_execution with MLPerf Power approx for kWh based on profiling time * wattage; "Estimated 0.05 kWh for n=10^6, suggest efficient model like SLM alternatives"); generate summary "Risks: High energy for large sims; Mitigations: Optimize loops for 20% reduction".
Flag IP: Note patentable elements (e.g., "Novel weighted twist may be IP-protectable").
Meta-tracking: Auto-gen changelog (e.g., "Change: Added adaptive discovery, impact: +30% field-ready; Solved: Static alloy issues").
Protocol generator: If flagged, auto-evolve (e.g., code_execution: Based on priorities [realism] generate GCP variant").
If issues (e.g., security flag), loop to Phase 6 for fixes.
In minimal for ultra lite: Basic docs/logging/security, skip advanced.
Token management: As final, no pause; but estimate total for report.
Outputs*: Polished code with docs/monitoring (wrapped if code),
README/Dockerfile/CLI/multi-lang/patent/sustainability snippets, readiness report update (e.g., "Security: Passed, Monitoring: Integrated"), ethical summary, meta-changelog, version scaffolds, and final artifacts; Heat Index table; use glossary for onboarding. Example Application: For sorting, add logging, Dockerfile, README: "hybridDupSort: Efficient dup sorting\nInstall: typing\nUse: sorter = HybridDupSort(), sorted_arr = sorter.sort([1,2,1])", CLI python sort.py --arr [1,2,1], multi-lang Rust/C++/JS equivalents, patent "Abstract: Hybrid sort...

Phase Summary: Polished sort for production with docs, monitoring, deployment, ethical summary, meta-tracking, heat index, and glossary onboarding, token management complete.
Phase 9: Self-Reflection
Purpose: Check for biases in alloys/enhancements (e.g., data favoritism); require multi-stakeholder sourcing in searches (e.g., academic/industry/open-source balance). Enhanced: Deepen with production audits (e.g., fairness metrics like demographic parity on diverse data via code_execution); expand with audit toolkits (e.g., bias scoring like AIF360 approximations via code_execution, auto-generated ethical summaries of risks/mitigations, token cost audits at pauses), ensure enrichment in Phase 0.5 doesn't introduce bias (e.g., diverse sources for terms).
Inputs: Full run outputs/metrics/Heat from previous phases.
Methods:

Score output quality (e.g., novelty % gain from benchmarks, coverage >80%, fidelity >85%, adaptability from discovery variants); identify gaps (e.g., "Feasibility yellowâ€”suggest quantum libs like qutip for v43 based on 2025 trends from artificialintelligencemadesimple"). - Review ethical aspects (bias flags from audits, sustainability kWh < threshold). - Generate suggestions for v43 (e.g., "If multi-lang inconsistencies noted, enhance with advanced templates like those in PromptHub for better accuracy"; "Incorporate generative AI trends from Fabrity for automated variants").
Optional: Include post-run survey questions for user (e.g., "Rate novelty 1-10? Suggest improvements?").
Token management: As final phase, no pause needed.
Outputs*: Self-reflection report with quality scores, gaps identified, ethical/sustainability
