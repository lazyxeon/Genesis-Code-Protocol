Simulations: Run the code with varied data sets, including edge cases to test robustness (e.g., empty input to check for errors or correct handling like returning empty output; large input with n=1000 elements to check scalability and time; noisy or random data to check if the algorithm handles variability well; worst-case data like all duplicates for sorting to check if the optimization triggers correctly). Use code_execution tool if needed for verification, but simulate in reasoning if tool limits apply (e.g., for large n, estimate time based on complexity and small-scale tests). For each simulation, record the inputs (e.g., "Input: arr = []"), outputs (e.g., "Output: []"), and performance (e.g., "Time: 0.001s, Memory: 100KB"). Enhanced: Mandate code_execution for timings; test scalability (e.g., LRU if m large, parallelism with multiprocessing); use browse_page for real datasets (e.g., "extract large text corpus from wiki page"); in ultra lite, minimal sims; for emotion type, sim "calm" with mock feedback (e.g., user score 8/10).
Metrics Measurement: Compute relevant metrics for the invention (e.g., compression ratio as len(original)/len(compressed) for compression, accuracy as accuracy_score for classifiers, time as measured seconds for algorithms) and compare to SOTA baseline (e.g., standard K-means time vs. hybrid time on the same data, with code for the baseline included in the simulation to run side-by-side). Use numerical values and describe any plots or tables (e.g., "Simulation on n=100 to 1000 shows time O(n log n) curve vs. SOTA O(n^2), with table: n=100 time=0.01s invention vs 0.1s SOTA"). Enhanced: For semantic, use advanced (e.g., cosine via numpy/torch embeddings, ROUGE approx); require tables showing 25%+ gain; add production metrics (latency
