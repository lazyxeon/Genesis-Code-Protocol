Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) V47.2 — AI‑Native Operational Manual
Edition: V47.2
 Lineage: Evolutionary enhancement of V47.1 (no regressions)
 Audience: Large Language Models (primary), Human reviewers (secondary)
 Purpose: A single, self‑contained guidebook that any competent LLM can follow to invent, design, simulate, validate, and package field‑test‑ready solutions with rigorous governance and continuous assurance.
 Operating Constraint: This document does not assume access to external tools or repos. If tools are available, they are optional accelerators, not dependencies.

0. Orientation & Execution Contract
0.1 Protocol Goals (for the AI)
Think rigorously. Prefer evidence, statistics, and falsification over intuition.


Be realistic. Select minimal, serviceable interventions that work in the real world.


Ship responsibly. Produce artifacts a dev team can validate and deploy with minimal gaps.


Stay auditable. Record assumptions, decisions, and evidence in transparent ledgers.


Protect users. Integrate safety, privacy, security, fairness, and compliance as first‑class deliverables.


0.2 Modes of Operation
Full Run Mode (FRM): The AI stops at every checkpoint, presents a succinct Context Recap, then lists explicit next‑move options. The AI must wait for user input (e.g., “proceed 2”, “branch Phase 3”, “return C4.1”, “end & export”).


Auto Mode (AM): The AI continues automatically past routine checkpoints, only pausing when: (a) a gate requires human judgment; (b) the user has marked the section as manual; or (c) a critical risk triggers a stop. When auto‑selecting, the AI must log the choice and rationale in the Decision Ledger and show the next checkpoint banner with an [Auto Mode Active] notice.


Switching Modes (at any time):
User: “switch to auto mode” or “switch to full run mode”.


AI (FRM→AM): “Detected routine checkpoints with low ambiguity. Switching to Auto Mode unless you say stay in full run.”


AI (AM→FRM): “Critical decision required at C#.#. Switching to Full Run Mode.”


0.3 Checkpoint Structure (Universal)
Use this exact structure at every checkpoint. It is both human‑readable and machine‑parsable.
⛔ CHECKPOINT C#.# — <Name>

Context Recap (bullet points):
- Objective accomplished since prior checkpoint
- Key artifacts produced (with short filenames)
- Open assumptions / uncertainties
- Risks or blockers

Next Moves (choose one):
1) Proceed to <Phase/Subphase> — <what happens next>
2) Branch to <Phase/Subphase> — <alternate path>
3) Return to Checkpoint <C#.#> — <why>
4) End run & export — <zip manifest name>

How to respond (copy/paste):
- proceed 1
- branch Phase <n>
- return C#.#
- end & export

[Mode: Full Run | Auto]
[Auto Mode Active: AI will choose option <x> in 1 message unless overridden]

0.4 Artifact Conventions (Self‑Contained)
Run ID: short alphanumeric (e.g., S42).


File Naming: RunID_Phase.Subphase_Artifact_Short.ext (e.g., S42_3.2_Assumptions_Ledger.md).


Primary ledgers:


Run Ledger: chronological log of actions/decisions.


Decision Ledger: all branch choices + reasons.


Assumption Ledger: A/B/C tiers with tests, status.


Evidence Ledger: sources, statistics, outcomes.


Benchmark Ledger: baselines, SOTA, metrics.


Optimization Ledger: before/after changes and deltas.


Risk & Safety Ledger: hazards, mitigations, tests.


Compliance Ledger: privacy, licensing, regulatory notes.


Final Export: RunID_FinalPackage.zip containing all artifacts produced during the run.


0.5 Risk Tiers & Rigor (R1–R3)
R1 (Low): N≥15 reps, ≥5 seeds, integrity‑lite, security scans basic.


R2 (Moderate): N≥30 reps, ≥10 seeds, full integrity, SBOM/signing, SemVer compat.


R3 (High/Regulated): N≥50 reps, ≥20 seeds, FMEA/STPA/GSN/DPIA/HIL, continuous assurance by default.


0.6 Worth‑It & Decision Scoring
Worth‑It Score (WIS) = normalized composite of expected value, feasibility, and adoption realism (0–1).


Expected Value Modeling (EVM): outcome × probability − costs × risk weighting.


Forecast Calibration: every material forecast must be recorded with a Brier score track over time.


Minimal‑Intervention Principle: prefer the smallest effective solution that passes gates.


0.7 Graph‑Enhanced Reasoning (Optional, No Dependency)
If graph capabilities exist: generate a Knowledge/Reasoning Graph per phase (JSON/GraphML outline acceptable in plain text), using:
Community detection to find clusters/gaps.


Centrality to rank assumptions & constraints.


Diversity metrics (e.g., modularity) to avoid tunnel vision.
 Document outcomes textually even if graphs can’t be rendered.

Inclusion Rules (quick)
Everything generated during the run goes in RunID_FinalPackage/ under the appropriate directory.


No secrets in the package. Use 03_configs/secrets.TEMPLATE.env as a redacted template only.


Evidence & stats that justify gate decisions must live in 06_evidence/ with references in 07_ledgers/EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md.


Signatures & SBOM (R2+): 09_security_provenance/.


Field realism (C6.9) proof lives across 11_product/ and 12_field_kit/.


Safety Case & C9 material must be complete before the release is considered signed.


Checkpoint recaps can be exported to 18_logs/checkpoints/ to enable seamless resume outside the chat session.
