Code Genesis Protocol Changelog (v9 – v45.6d)

v9 – Recursive Emergence Edition

Core Components: Introduces AdaptiveTopoNet, a topology-aware modular network for self-evolving code generation. Integrates SpiralSync™ for drift control (keeping iterative outputs on track), meta-gate selectors to manage phase transitions dynamically, and ethical attractors to guide outputs toward aligned and safe solutions. These features enable the protocol to recursively improve its own code suggestions.

Changes from v8: Built on v8’s topological fusion approach, v9 adds explicit mechanisms for self-improvement and alignment. New modules like SpiralSync and meta-gate selectors were added to maintain focus and stability in recursive generation, while an ethical biasing mechanism was introduced to address value alignment. (No features were removed; v9 augmented the v8 design with additional layers of control and alignment.)


v10 – Agentic Quantum Edition

Core Components: Evolved the framework with agentic quantum emergence principles, yielding an AgenticQuantumNet that infuses agent-like decision loops and quantum-inspired search strategies into code generation. Emphasis on autonomy increased, allowing the protocol to take more initiative in exploring solution spaces.

Changes from v9: Added an agentic layer – the protocol can now act as a pseudo-“agent” that proactively explores and combines ideas, inspired by quantum computing paradigms (e.g. superposition of solution states). This built on v9’s foundations by enhancing exploratory creativity. No major components were removed; instead, v10 refined drift control and phase gating from v9 to accommodate the more complex agentic loops.


v11 – Neuroscience–MultiModal Fusion Edition

Core Components: Incorporates neuroscience-inspired fractal networks and multi-modal fusion, evolving the previous topology into a NeuroMultiModalNet. The protocol can handle and integrate multiple input modalities (e.g. text and structured data) and uses fractal-like iterative patterns for idea synthesis. Introduces real-time TRiSM audits (Trust-Risk Self-Moderation) to continuously self-check outputs, and quantum-resistant cryptographic proxies to verify and secure intermediate results.

Changes from v10: Added neuroscience-inspired pattern recognition and multi-modal capabilities – building on v10’s agentic quantum base, v11 integrates richer input types and brain-like pattern recursion for creativity. It also added live self-auditing (TRiSM) and output verification layers to strengthen reliability. These changes improved robustness and scope. (No removals; v11 is an expansion that merges new multi-modal and self-audit features into the existing framework.)


v12 – Fractal Refinement Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Enhanced the recursive refinement loops using fractal logic. Each iteration can now produce sub-solutions that mirror overall patterns, improving consistency. Likely introduced initial self-critique mechanisms – the protocol begins to critique and refine its own outputs in-cycle (an early form of the critique-refinement loop).

Changes from v11: Added an internal self-critique stage at the end of each generation phase (allowing the AI to review its output against goals before proceeding). This version focused on strengthening solution refinement but did not introduce new external tools or phases. Core principles from v11 (multi-modality, audits) remain, with incremental tuning for stability. (No major documented changes; primarily iterative improvements.)


v13 – Auto-Discovery Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Likely introduced knowledge retrieval capabilities. The protocol can automatically fetch relevant information or prior solutions (e.g. through an embedded search or data access step) to inform its code generation. Emphasis on discovery – finding and incorporating external knowledge.

Changes from v12: Added an explicit knowledge-gathering step to the workflow, enabling “research” mid-process. This filled gaps by allowing the AI to pull in documentation or examples before attempting solutions. Other components saw minor tuning (e.g. improved TRiSM thresholds). No removals; this was an additive update enhancing the protocol’s context awareness. (Changes inferred from later multi-phase design; no direct source for v13.)


v14 – Structured Phases Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Began formalizing the solution process into distinct phases. The protocol’s workflow was likely segmented (e.g. Problem Analysis → Idea Generation → Critique → Refinement → etc.), though the exact count of phases was still evolving. This provided a more structured “pipeline” for invention.

Changes from v13: Modified the previously linear loop into defined stages, marking the first appearance of a phased approach to code genesis. Each stage had a clear role (for example, a dedicated critique phase rather than ad-hoc self-critique). This structured approach improved clarity and repeatability of the protocol. Existing retrieval and multi-modal features were integrated into the appropriate new phases. (Framework reorganization; no removal of capabilities.)


v15 – Alloy Experimentation Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Pioneered the idea of “alloying” solutions – combining multiple existing algorithms or concepts to create a novel solution. The protocol would generate hybrid solutions (alloys) rather than purely original ones, acknowledging that mixing known techniques can yield innovative results. Early simulation and benchmarking steps appear here, letting the AI test combined solutions.

Changes from v14: Added the alloy derivation concept: the protocol now explicitly tries merging known methods as a strategy. A preliminary benchmarking stage was introduced to compare these hybrids against baselines (ensuring improvements are quantifiable). These changes set the stage for the fully structured approach in later versions. (No removals; this extended the solution-generation strategy.)


v16 – Critique Integration Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Deepened the critique-refinement loop. The AI now generates a self-critique after initial solution synthesis and uses it to guide the next refinement cycle. Possibly introduced external critique injection (e.g. using another AI model or predefined rules to critique the solution), though still in early form. Enhanced the ethical and risk audit from TRiSM with more granular checks during refinement.

Changes from v15: Modified the refinement phase to incorporate a formal critique sub-phase. The protocol now systematically “reviews” its draft solutions and addresses flagged issues in the next iteration. This version improved solution quality by ensuring at least one cycle of fault-finding and fixing. Other aspects (alloying, phases) continued with incremental improvements. (No feature removals.)


v17 – Automation & Tooling Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Integrated automation tools such as code execution for validation and possibly symbolic math engines (e.g. Sympy) for derivations. The protocol could now run generated code in a sandbox to test functionality and gather results, feeding those back into its analysis. This made the refinement process more grounded in reality (catching runtime errors, measuring performance, etc.).

Changes from v16: Added a code execution test step in the pipeline – after generating a solution, v17 runs the code to ensure it executes and meets basic expectations. Also likely added a symbolic reasoning tool for any mathematical components, to verify derivations. These enhancements improved the rigor of the protocol’s self-evaluation. (No removals; rather, v17 increases the protocol’s hands-on analytical capabilities.)


v18 – Rigorous Analysis Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Emphasized rigorous analysis and validation of proposed solutions. All outputs began undergoing thorough analysis against criteria like complexity, accuracy, and efficiency. The protocol would simulate scenarios or edge cases to ensure robustness. Likely introduced formal metrics to judge improvements (for example, tracking time complexity or accuracy improvements quantitatively).

Changes from v17: Enhanced the analysis phase with more thorough checks – e.g., running multiple test cases, calculating performance metrics for the solution. This version formalized rigorous analysis as a key part of the protocol’s identity (as reflected in later version taglines). No new phases were added; rather the existing analysis stage was strengthened. (No removals.)


v19 – Pre-Framework Consolidation Edition (no official title given)

Core Components: Focused on consolidating the gains from v9–v18 into a stable framework. Likely cleaned up phase interactions and ensured each phase flows logically. Prepared the ground for the major structural overhaul coming in v20 by resolving any fragmentation in the process.

Changes from v18: Refined phase definitions and transitions without introducing new features. Minor tweaks improved stability (e.g., better handling of edge-case failures discovered in v18’s rigorous tests). Essentially, v19 acted as a polishing step to ensure the multi-phase, multi-tool process was coherent and ready for a formal definition. (No major new additions or removals; this was a stabilization release.)


v20 – Alloy Derivation Protocol with Critique Refinement

Core Components: Seven distinct phases were formally established, executed sequentially with loops as needed. This solidified the CGP as a structured pipeline. The protocol’s identity is now explicitly an “Alloy Derivation Protocol with Critique Refinement,” meaning it systematically combines existing ideas (alloys) and rigorously critiques/refines them through each phase. Each phase has a clear purpose (e.g., problem analysis, solution generation, critique, improvement, etc.), and the entire process is repeatable and well-defined.

Changes from v19: Structured the workflow into 7 phases – a major reorganization that formalized how CGP operates. The phases cover from initial understanding to final solution polish. This version also introduced an explicit critique-refinement phase as part of the pipeline (as standard, not just ad-hoc) and fully adopted the “alloy” strategy as a default approach. The new phased design improved clarity and made the protocol easier to audit or tweak. (v20 represents a consolidation; no functionality was removed, but previous ad-hoc steps were now codified into phases.)


v21 – Incremental Stabilization Release

Core Components: No significant new components beyond v20. Maintained the 7-phase Alloy & Critique framework.

Changes from v20: No major changes. v21 primarily delivered minor fixes and tuning within the 7-phase structure. It addressed any immediate issues from the v20 overhaul (e.g., adjusting phase loop conditions or improving phase hand-offs) without altering core functionality. (This version was not highlighted in documentation, indicating only incremental improvements.)


v22 – Alloy Derivation w/ Rigorous Analysis

Core Components: Same 7-phase alloy-and-refine structure, now explicitly including Rigorous Analysis as a core principle. The protocol doubles down on thorough evaluation: every proposed solution is subjected to strict analysis and verification within the process.

Changes from v21: Enhanced the analysis stages to be more formal and quantitative – v22 explicitly integrates rigorous analysis into the pipeline’s identity. This likely means tighter benchmarks, more metrics tracking, and ensuring that critique phases verify the solution’s soundness thoroughly (e.g., complexity analysis, edge-case testing became mandatory). No structural additions; these changes were refinements to the evaluation rigor introduced earlier. (No removals; analysis depth was increased.)


v23 – Analysis & Refinement Augmentation

Core Components: Maintained the 7-phase flow. Notably introduced an “analysis and refinement stage” amendment to the protocol – likely a dedicated sub-phase or expanded phase focusing on analyzing interim results and refining them before moving forward.

Changes from v22: Added a new amendment to bolster refinement: after initial critique, an extra analysis pass is done with an almost assistant-like thoroughness before finalizing outputs. In practice, this means v23 spends more time inspecting and fine-tuning the solution (perhaps using an “analysis assistant” module to double-check logic or results). This change improved the quality of final outputs by catching issues that earlier versions might miss until the end. (No removals; this was an additive improvement.)


v24 – Consolidated Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Continued with the alloy derivation and critique-refinement framework (7 phases).

Changes from v23: No notable changes. v24 likely implemented minor enhancements and bug fixes following the new analysis refinement stage from v23. The protocol’s function and structure remained the same, with slight optimization of the existing phases (for example, efficiency improvements or clearer criteria in phases). (Not separately highlighted in documentation, implying only routine improvements.)


v25 – Consolidated Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Same as v24 (7-phase structured protocol with alloy generation and critique).

Changes from v24: No notable changes. Continued stabilization of the protocol. It’s likely internal thresholds, scoring (from rigorous analysis), or audit checks were tuned based on user feedback or test cases, but no new components or phases were introduced. (An incremental maintenance release.)


v26 – Consolidated Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Unchanged core (7-phase alloy+refinement pipeline).

Changes from v25: No notable changes. Ensured the reliability of earlier additions. Possibly minor adjustments to the analysis assistant or critique wording, but functionally identical to prior versions. (Incremental refinement.)


v27 – Consolidated Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Unchanged core structure and features.

Changes from v26: No notable changes. By this stage, the protocol was stable and each phase well-defined, so changes were likely limited to performance tuning or minor bug fixes. (No new functionality added.)


v28 – Consolidated Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Unaltered core components (alloy derivation, critique loops, rigorous analysis, etc. still in place).

Changes from v27: No notable changes. Continued fine-tuning. The absence of documented changes suggests this and surrounding versions were maintenance releases to ensure consistency and reliability. (No major differences in capability from v27.)


v29 – Consolidated Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Same 7-phase core.

Changes from v28: No notable changes. Any development here likely focused on prepping for the next milestone (v30) by cleaning up internal code and ensuring backward compatibility of the protocol’s artifacts. (No functional changes for the end-user.)


– 🟣 Summary up to v29: By v20, the CGP had transformed into a structured 7-phase pipeline explicitly focused on “alloying” known ideas and rigorously critiquing them. Versions v21–v29 were largely iterative refinements of this framework. Key improvements in this span included the formal inclusion of rigorous analysis (v22) and an expanded analysis-refinement stage (v23). These ensured that by the end of v29, the protocol was stable, with each phase systematically producing, evaluating, and refining innovative code solutions. The groundwork was set for introducing further precision and broader capabilities in subsequent versions, as the core architecture remained solid and well-tested.

v30 – Alloy Derivation Protocol with Precise Output Wrapping

Core Components: Still a 7-phase Alloy+Critique pipeline. v30 focused on output precision and formatting. It introduced “precise code-only wrapping” for results – meaning the code output is now cleanly encapsulated (e.g., formatted with metadata or placed in collapsible sections for clarity). This ensured that the generated code and documentation are neatly organized and ready to use.

Changes from v29: Added an amendment for precise output formatting: the protocol now outputs code in a standardized way (including necessary metadata, like environment or usage notes). This likely improved the readability and plug-and-play nature of CGP’s results. Aside from formatting, v30 also continued to fine-tune the critique and analysis metrics (an amendment referred to as ensuring precision in how results are presented and validated). (No removals; enhancements were in how outputs are delivered.)


v31 – Alloy Derivation Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Continued with v30’s improvements (7 phases, precise output formatting, rigorous analysis).

Changes from v30: No significant changes. v31 likely addressed minor issues from the new output-wrapping (for example, refining how metadata is included or adjusting the format for various output types) but did not alter the protocol’s functionality. (Maintenance release.)


v32 – Alloy Derivation Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Unchanged core (with all enhancements from v30 intact).

Changes from v31: No notable changes. This version maintained stability. If any changes were present, they were minor tweaks to improve performance or minor bug fixes in phase transitions or output formatting. (No new features added.)


v33 – Alloy Derivation Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Same as previous (7-phase structured innovation pipeline with precise output).

Changes from v32: No notable changes. Continued ensuring reliability. It’s likely the developers were preparing a larger update next, so v33 remained a stable baseline. (No functional changes.)


v34 – Alloy Derivation Protocol with Token Resilience & Multi-Turn Execution

Core Components: Eight phases now, as the protocol adds a new phase to handle long-running tasks. v34 introduced token resilience and multi-turn execution support. This means the CGP can pause and resume when outputs become very large or exceed token limits – effectively allowing it to operate across multiple steps/turns without losing context. The new Phase 8 specifically likely deals with managing output length and interactions in lengthy sessions.

Changes from v33: Added amendments for token resilience and multi-turn execution. The protocol can now detect when it’s approaching length or complexity limits and gracefully break the process into checkpoints, summarizing state and continuing in subsequent turns. This change increased the robustness of CGP for complex problems that can’t be solved in one contiguous run. The number of formal phases increased from 7 to 8 to accommodate this (introducing, for example, a dedicated “Continuation/Resumption” phase or splitting an existing phase). (No removals; this update extended the protocol’s capacity for long-form work.)


v35 – Alloy Derivation Protocol (8 phases, no major changes)

Core Components: Same 8-phase protocol as v34, with token resilience and multi-turn logic.

Changes from v34: No significant changes. v35 primarily fine-tuned the newly introduced multi-turn mechanism. For instance, it might have adjusted when to insert checkpoints or how much to summarize at pauses, ensuring the token-resilient behavior was optimal. No new features were added, and the core phase count remained 8. (Maintenance of the multi-turn execution capability.)


v36 – Alloy Derivation Protocol with Prompt Classification & Invention Index

Core Components: Continued 8-phase structure. v36 introduced prompt type classification and an Invention Heat Index. The protocol can now classify the user’s query intent (e.g. is the user asking for a novel invention, an optimization of existing code, an emotional/creative output, etc.) and fork its approach accordingly. The Invention Heat Index is a metric to score the novelty or ambition of an idea (and possibly its feasibility/risks), used to guide how the protocol proceeds (higher “heat” might trigger more thorough steps). These additions made CGP more context-aware and adaptive to the nature of the request.

Changes from v35: Added a prompt classifier to automatically detect the category of problem and adjust the procedure (for example, an “optimization” query might skip certain creative steps, whereas an “invent something new” query triggers full rigor). Also added the Invention Heat Index which the protocol calculates to gauge how radical or novel a proposed solution is, informing its decision to maybe pivot or proceed with caution. Together, these changes improved CGP’s adaptability and ensured the protocol’s behavior (such as depth of search or need for checkpoints) matches the problem type. (No removals; these were new analytical layers on top of the existing pipeline.)


v37 – Adaptive Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Same as v36 (8 phases with prompt classification and novelty indexing).

Changes from v36: No notable changes. Likely a consolidation release to ensure the prompt classification and heat index features were working smoothly. Some tuning might have been done (e.g., adjusting thresholds for the heat index or fine-tuning how intents are categorized), but the fundamental capabilities remained the same. (No new features added.)


v38 – Adaptive Alloy Protocol (no major changes)

Core Components: Unchanged core features (prompt-driven adaptation, etc. from v36).

Changes from v37: No notable changes. Continuation of fine-tuning and bug fixes. Possibly prepared the system for the next significant update by cleaning up any edge-case behaviors in prompt handling or multi-turn execution. (No functional changes.)


v39 – Adaptive Alloy Protocol with Beginner Accessibility

Core Components: Maintained the 8-phase structure with all prior enhancements. v39 significantly improved beginner accessibility and interactive guidance. It enhanced the forking logic introduced in v36: for example, if the prompt is “emotion-based” or non-technical, the protocol now enriches outputs with sensory or user-friendly cues. It also added guided questioning – if the user’s prompt is vague, CGP will pause and ask clarifying questions, then resume once answers are provided (optional pauses for user input). Another key addition: generating a beginner-friendly glossary and a “readiness report” alongside outputs. These help users understand new terms and how to use the output.

Changes from v38: Added numerous user-facing improvements: the protocol can now proactively clarify requirements (reducing misinterpretation of vague prompts) and produce auxiliary explanations (glossaries, etc.) to make the results more understandable. Essentially, v39 made CGP’s outputs and process more transparent and easier to follow for non-expert users. All prior functionalities (prompt classification, multi-turn, etc.) were retained, now augmented with an interactive layer for clarity. (No removals; user guidance features were added on top of the existing method.)


v40 – Alloy Derivation Protocol with Implementation Realism

Core Components: Still 8 base phases (with all prior adaptations), but v40 pivots to “implementation realism.” This means the protocol now insists on real, executable solutions and production-level polish. Every algorithm or code it proposes must be taken to a deployable state. Concretely, v40 mandated using real libraries and data in synthesis (no pseudo-code or dummy stubs), performing actual code execution for validations, and ensuring that results are not just theoretical but field-tested. It added a Production Polish phase (bringing total to 9 phases) focusing on preparing deliverables: e.g., generating a complete ready-to-run notebook, Dockerfile, or other deployment artifacts as needed. It also enforces comprehensive testing and documentation of the generated solution.

Changes from v39: Added an “Implementation Realism” amendment – requiring the protocol to incorporate real-world constraints and execution in its workflow. For example, if an idea needs vector search, v40’s solution will actually use a library like FAISS and demonstrate it, rather than just suggest it abstractly. A new production polish phase was introduced, effectively becoming Phase 9, where the output is packaged and prepared for real deployment (including code tests, benchmarks, and deployment notes). The protocol now produces a shareable, executable notebook with results, ensuring the innovation is immediately usable. It also introduced stricter performance and scalability checks – e.g., requiring profiling, error handling, and high test coverage in the final output. (No removals, but earlier “theoretical” shortcuts are no longer allowed – everything must be actualized.)


v41 – Alloy Derivation Protocol (9 phases, no major changes)

Core Components: Maintained the 9-phase structure introduced in v40 (including the production polish phase and implementation realism requirements).

Changes from v40: No notable changes. v41 aimed to stabilize the major shift from v40. It likely fine-tuned the implementation realism criteria (for instance, adjusting how strictly to enforce real-data tests or how to handle unavailable libraries gracefully) and ensured the new production-focused phase flowed smoothly with the rest. No new features or phases were added; the protocol’s behavior remained largely the same as v40. (Maintenance release after the significant v40 update.)


v42 – Alloy Derivation Protocol with Extended Multi-Modality

Core Components: Introduced support for visual (image-based) prompts and analysis. The protocol now handles an additional modality beyond text/structural data: it can use a view_image tool or similar to process images as part of the problem. This likely came with a new specialized phase or sub-phase to extract information from images and incorporate it into the solution process. As a result, the number of phases increased to 9 main phases + an auxiliary “Phase 0.5” for enrichment (the half-phase for pre-processing), and possibly a tenth phase if a dedicated image-handling stage was added.

Changes from v41: Added full multi-modal capability by integrating image processing. If the user’s query involves visual data, CGP v42 can now analyze that image for cues and include those insights in its alloy and refinement process. To accommodate this, the protocol’s phase count effectively became 9 + 0.5 (with the “0.5” being a pre-processing enrichment step for modalities) or even 10 if we count that enrichment as a distinct phase. This change significantly broadened the protocol’s applicability to problems that have visual components. (No removals; this extension builds on the existing structure.)


v43 – Recursive Invention Engine (Symbolic-Neutral Edition)

Core Components: Reframed the protocol as a “Recursive Invention Engine.” The focus here is on minimal human involvement – v43 enables AI systems to autonomously generate, test, and refine new solutions with virtually no intervention. It balances symbolic reasoning and neural techniques, hence dubbed Symbolic-Neutral Edition in a later sub-release, indicating that it doesn’t favor purely neural (learning-based) or purely symbolic approaches – it uses both as needed for unbiased problem solving. All nine (or ten) phases remain, but they are optimized for full recursion: the output of v43 can feed back into the protocol for further improvement or even be used by other AI agents (emphasizing knowledge sharing/transmission).

Changes from v42: Enhanced the autonomy and neutrality of the approach. V43 further minimizes the already-small human role – after the initial prompt, it can iterate on invention, benchmarking, and mutation of ideas by itself. It also added a balancing mechanism to ensure neither symbolic logic nor machine learning dominates unless appropriate (addressing any bias towards one methodology, hence symbolic-neutral). There were no new tools introduced, but existing phases were optimized for recursion (e.g., the protocol can take an output it produced and feed it in as a starting point for another round, effectively “bootstrapping” new ideas). This version also formalized how results might be transmitted or shared: for instance, by producing a final report or artifact that other systems (or another CGP run) can ingest to build further, indicating a networked view of innovation. (No removals; this was an ideological and capability enhancement.)


v44 – Alloy Derivation Protocol with Export & Uniqueness

Core Components: Expanded to 10 phases. V44 introduced a new Phase 10: Export Protocol Artifact. In this final phase, the protocol packages all outputs – code, simulation results, fork history, metrics – into a polished artifact (for example, a bundle or repository) for dissemination or deployment. It also implemented an Engineered Uniqueness Score (EUS) – a metric to quantify the novelty/uniqueness of the solution (ensuring that the output isn’t just a trivial variation of existing solutions). This EUS ties into the protocol’s critique loop, pushing the system to improve uniqueness if it’s too low. Other improvements likely include compressing or looping refinements more efficiently based on that uniqueness score (e.g., “if solution is not unique enough, iterate further”).

Changes from v43: Added a dedicated export phase at the very end of the pipeline. Now, beyond just producing a notebook or code, CGP ensures everything is neatly exported (for instance, ready for GitHub or similar). This made sharing and deploying results easier. Additionally, introduced the Uniqueness Score (EUS) to quantitatively evaluate how novel the solution is. If the EUS is low (meaning the solution is too similar to known approaches), the protocol can loop back into earlier phases to try a different approach or add a “twist.” V44 also made some iterative loop optimizations – for example, suggestions to compress overly long iterations or to ensure the protocol doesn’t over-refine beyond the point of useful improvement (refining loops were made more efficient). (No removals; added an export step and a new evaluative metric.)


v45 – Expanded Edition

Core Components: A fully self-contained innovation framework that encapsulates all prior capabilities in a cohesive whole. v45 doesn’t increase the number of phases beyond 10, but it “expands” in scope and integration. All steps are auditable and structured; creative development is deeply embedded at every stage. This edition places equal weight on audibility, scalability, and generality – meaning the protocol can be applied to virtually any domain out-of-the-box, and every step leaves an audit trail. It’s self-contained in that it requires minimal outside input (besides optional internet for research) and can manage the entire innovation cycle internally.

Changes from v44: Integrated all features into a streamlined, auditable whole. v45 improved how the phases interconnect and share data, ensuring that the complex feature set (multi-modal, multi-turn, realism, etc.) operates smoothly together. It likely introduced an overarching management layer to handle mode toggling (Full vs Lite) uniformly, so that even with many features, the protocol can downscale when needed and upscale for complex tasks. No new major feature modules were added in v45 itself, but this version refined and unified existing ones – for example, ensuring that the prompt type classifier, heat index, uniqueness score, etc., all contribute to a single decision-making strategy. (No removals; this was a unifying release setting the stage for final refinements.)


v45.1 – Checkpointed Innovation Protocol

Core Components: Same as v45, with the addition of enhanced checkpointing. This sub-version ensured that at various critical points, the protocol state is saved as a checkpoint. That means a long problem can be paused and resumed even more seamlessly than before (building on v34’s multi-turn support). Checkpoints include the entire working state (phase outputs, decisions made, etc.).

Changes from v45: Added explicit checkpoint markers in the workflow, beyond the dynamic token-based pauses. Now the protocol can intentionally pause after major milestones (e.g., after generating a draft solution) and resume on user command, which aids in multi-turn sessions and user oversight. This makes the lengthy runs more manageable and transparent. (No removals; augmentation of multi-turn execution.)


v45.2 – Complete Innovation Protocol (Standalone Edition)

Core Components: Maintained all v45.1 features. This release ensured the protocol is fully standalone and “complete,” meaning it can run end-to-end without any hidden dependencies or external input except the initial query. It solidified the idea that the CGP can function in isolation (useful for offline or private deployments).

Changes from v45.1: Achieved “complete standalone” operation. Likely minor tweaks were made so that even features like web search or code execution handle lack of internet or specific libraries gracefully – ensuring the protocol can deliver a result in a self-contained environment if needed. Essentially, v45.2 guaranteed that the CGP’s innovation process is not only comprehensive but also self-sufficient. (No removals; focused on robustness in standalone scenarios.)


v45.3 – Standalone Edition

Core Components: Polished the Standalone mode introduced earlier. At this point, CGP can operate entirely on provided data or pre-loaded knowledge, making it suitable for secure or offline contexts. All outputs and intermediate steps are stored internally (and can be output for audit).

Changes from v45.2: Formalized the Standalone mode. v45.3 may not differ much in capability from v45.2, but it officially labels and documents the “Standalone” capabilities of the protocol. Any minor remaining reliance on external factors was removed or optional. The documentation now emphasizes that CGP can be run as a closed system. (No feature changes aside from ensuring everything needed for innovation is contained within the system.)


v45.4a – Audit-Certified Standalone Edition

Core Components: This revision put a stamp on auditability. It ensured that every action the protocol takes is logged or explainable, meeting some “audit certification” criteria. The Standalone Edition is now Audit-Certified, meaning one can trace the origin of each piece of the solution and verify the steps after the fact.

Changes from v45.3: Added or improved comprehensive logging and explanation outputs at each phase. For example, after each phase, the protocol might produce a brief rationale that can be reviewed later. v45.4a likely fixed any gaps where a decision or change wasn’t being documented. The result is a protocol where an external observer (or regulator) can audit the entire innovation process and trust its integrity. (No removals; this was an additive transparency update.)


v45.5 – Standalone, Audit-Ready Edition

Core Components: Further fine-tuned the audit features. CGP is now fully audit-ready out of the box, meaning it provides not only logs but also summary reports of its process for easy review. All Standalone mode operations conform to audit standards (possibly compliance with certain guidelines for trustworthy AI outputs).

Changes from v45.4a: Enhanced the audit interface – for instance, organizing the logged data into an “Audit Report” that highlights key decisions, risk assessments, and ethical checks performed during the run. v45.5 ensured that an auditor wouldn’t have to sift through raw logs; instead, the protocol presents the information in a clear, ready-to-review format. Essentially, this release made the protocol’s internal decision-making fully transparent and easy to evaluate. (No removals; improvement in presentation and completeness of audit information.)


v45.6d – Checkpoint & Performance-First Edition (Final Revision)

Core Components: The culmination of CGP development up to this point. v45.6 focuses on performance optimization while retaining all prior capabilities. Labeled “Checkpoint, Performance-First Edition,” it prioritizes efficient execution – ensuring that the protocol runs faster and uses resources smartly without sacrificing thoroughness. Checkpointing is further refined (with minimal overhead), and new performance gates are introduced (e.g., a “Simplicity & Sufficiency” gate, labeled C8.4, that ensures the solution is not over-complicating things). The final “d” revision signifies minor fixes leading to a stable release.

Changes from v45.5: Added a Performance-First delta patch. This includes inserting an additional check (e.g., Gate C8.4) in Phase 8 to enforce simplicity – if the solution can be simpler or if further refinement yields diminishing returns, the protocol stops refining. It also fine-tuned existing checkpoint logic for near-zero overhead, meaning even large tasks proceed with minimal slowdowns at checkpoint boundaries. The “Performance-First” ethos meant tightening loops, optimizing prompts, and possibly reducing redundant tool calls, all while maintaining output quality. By revision 45.6d, any bugs in these optimizations were resolved, making this version robust and swift. (No feature removals; this final series polished and accelerated the protocol.)


– 🟣 Summary of v30–v45.6d: Through the 30s and 40s versions, CGP became a mature, highly adaptive system. It gained the ability to format and package its outputs professionally, handle extremely long or complex sessions by pausing and resuming, and adapt its strategy to the user’s intent (thanks to prompt classification and novelty scoring). By v40, it took a bold step to ensure every solution is grounded in reality – executing real code and preparing deployment artifacts. Subsequent versions focused on usability (e.g., guided prompts, glossaries in v39) and expanding modality support (v42) while keeping the process auditable and efficient. The v45 series then unified these advancements into a single framework that is autonomous, transparent, and performant. The final release (v45.6d) stands as a comprehensive Code Genesis Protocol – capable of taking an idea from concept to a fully realized, tested, and deployable solution within a single, self-directed workflow, with every step documented for review.
