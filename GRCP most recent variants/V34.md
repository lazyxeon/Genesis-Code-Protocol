Code Genesis Protocol (GCP) v34: Alloy Derivation Protocol with Critique Refinement, Rigorous Analysis, Scalability, Production Polish, Mode Flexibility, and Token Resilience Amendment

Introduction and Overview
The Code Genesis Protocol (GCP) v34 is a structured, iterative framework designed to facilitate the invention of novel algorithms and code solutions by leveraging the alloying of existing techniques with new mathematical derivations. This version builds on v33 by introducing dynamic token management for resilience in long executions, with mandatory stop-and-wait points to handle token limitations in chat interfaces, ensuring phases are never truncated or summarized prematurely. It incorporates multi-turn strategies like rolling contexts and chunking, per-phase tool budgets to prevent overflow, expanded ethical audits with token cost warnings during pauses, and stronger regression benchmarks for version comparisons. These enhancements make GCP more robust for real-time interactions, allowing full organic expansion up to a threshold (e.g., 125k tokens, reserving 1k for summaries), then pausing with a state summary and waiting for user continuation. This prevents "internalizing" phases while maintaining the protocol's commitment to no truncation, enabling seamless multi-turn runs without losing detail or coherence.

The protocol remains adaptive and self-reflective, ensuring that outputs are practically functional, mathematically rigorous, verifiable through simulations and benchmarks, and superior to existing methods in key metrics such as complexity, efficiency, accuracy, or other problem-specific measures. It incorporates tools for gap assessment, mathematical derivation, code synthesis, analysis, refinement based on critiques and simulations, validation with fixes, benchmarking with a complete, ready-to-use Google Colab notebook, and a final polish for production readiness. The notebook generation ensures that the invention or enhancement is packaged in a shareable, executable format that includes setup, code tests, benchmarks, and results, making it immediately usable for verification and further experimentation. Additionally, the production polish phase generates artifacts like Dockerfiles, API documentation, and monitoring stubs to facilitate deployment, now universally applied to maintain quality uniformity, with token-aware pauses integrated across phases for long runs.

The protocol supports problems where solutions exist but have limitations, encouraging hybrids or enhancements that are "different designs" or polished improvements with measurable benefits. It avoids placeholders, truncation, or summaries—all sections are fully expanded with detailed explanations, methods, and examples. The process is organic, with each phase building logically on the previous one, and includes explicit instructions for handling iterations, pivots, and tool fallbacks. For production polish, phases emphasize robustness against real-world failures, scalability to handle large-scale data or users, comprehensive testing to achieve high coverage, monitoring to detect issues post-deployment, and ethical considerations to mitigate biases amplified in production. Modes (Full, Lite, Ultra Lite) provide flexibility, with ultra lite skipping more for trivial tasks but always routing to Phase 8 for polish, ensuring no output compromises on professional standards. Token resilience is woven in: Estimate usage per phase (via tiktoken or word count fallback), expand to threshold, summarize state,

and pause for continuation, rolling the summary into the next turn's context.

Core Principles
Alloy and Enhancement Prioritization: Outputs can be new designs via alloying or genuine enhancements of undervalued or non-SOTA methods, focusing on practical improvements rather than forced novelty. Hybrids/polishing are encouraged to create diverse or refined solutions that address gaps without unnecessary complexity. In production contexts, prioritization includes modularity for easy integration and extensibility. Enhanced: Require mode flagging with rationale to ensure appropriate skips without quality loss.
Rigorous Derivation: All outputs must stem from first-principles math, solved step-by-step for closed-ended verification, ensuring soundness and not arbitrary. For enhancements, derive why the polish improves metrics, including explicit "improvement proof" (e.g., quantify % gain via bounds or simulations). Enhanced for production: Include "production proof" such as derivation of scalability bounds (e.g., parallel time reductions) and error resilience (e.g., fault-tolerant equations); incorporate protocol-level iterations for regression testing across versions. -
Iterative Refinement*: Built-in loops for analysis, critique incorporation, simulation with edge cases, and validation to ensure functionality, with explicit options to pivot if confining (e.g., switch to undervalued base). Refinement now includes production iterations for robustness and monitoring, with mode-specific loops to balance efficiency and thoroughness. Enhanced: Add multi-turn loops with stop/wait points for long runs to manage token limits. - Tool Integration: Utilize web_search for gaps and trends (broadened to include lesser-known sources), code_execution for testing and simulations, sympy for mathematical solving, and other tools as needed. Specific guidance: If sympy fails to solve an equation (e.g., due to non-linear or unsolvable form), fallback to numerical methods with numpy or scipy (e.g., use scipy.optimize.minimize to find numerical values instead of symbolic, and document "Sympy couldn't solve exactly, approximated with scipy.optimize.minimize for min lambda = (MSE + variance)"). Enhanced: Mandate parallel tool calls where applicable (e.g., web_search + code_execution for metric validation and production tools like profiling with cProfile or unit testing with pytest); integrate advanced libraries like torch for embeddings or multiprocessing for parallelism if available in env; add abstraction layer (e.g., tool registries/budgets per mode/phase for observability and single responsibility, e.g., 2 calls per phase in lite to avoid overflow).
Novelty, Enhancement, and Usefulness: Prioritize utility; if novel, label as such; if enhancement of non-SOTA, label "not novel but genuine enhancement" without novelty. Ensure diverse/grounded (filter pseudoscience via reliable sources) and useful (better in key metrics). Enhanced: Include real-world applicability score (e.g., deployment cost estimate via quick web_search) and potential risks (e.g., bias in data selection); require production risks like latency under load or drift in long-term use; add meta-tracking for evolution (structured changelogs linking changes to impacts and solved problems).
Benchmark Notebook Generation: During benchmarking, automatically develop a full Google Colab-ready notebook (.ipynb JSON format) with all code, tests, benchmarks, edge cases, and outputs for copy-paste execution. Enhanced: Include sections for production profiling and deployment guidance.
No Placeholders or Truncation: All sections are fully fleshed out with explanations, examples, and no summaries—everything is explicit and ready for immediate use. Enhanced: Token management ensures no truncation by pausing with summaries only at
designated points, rolling into next turns.

Organic Expansion: The protocol is described in a natural, detailed manner, with each phase expanded to include full reasoning, methods, and applications, ensuring it can be applied directly without additional interpretation.
Pivot Triggers: In addition to diversity scores, include performance triggers (e.g., if improvement <15% over SOTA in metrics like time or accuracy), complexity triggers (e.g., if time complexity worsens from SOTA, such as from O(n log n) to O(n^2)), semantic degradation triggers (e.g., if fidelity metrics show <80% preservation of meaning in domain-specific tests like NLP, pivot to a different alloy), and confinement triggers (e.g., if SOTA dominates results, pivot to undervalued sources). Enhanced: Add production triggers (e.g., if test coverage <80% or latency > threshold, pivot for robustness).
Semantic Fidelity Requirement: For problems involving data with inherent meaning (e.g., tokens, text, images), Phases 4-6 must include domain-specific metrics (e.g., BLEU/ROUGE for text, PSNR for images) and checks for "meaningless" outputs (e.g., if regen produces repetitive dummies, flag as naive and pivot). Enhanced: Use advanced proxies like cosine similarity via embeddings for relevance; include fairness metrics for bias in production. - Code Presentation: All code outputs must be enclosed in
[Appropriate Title, e.g., "View Synthesized Code"]
to create collapsible sections, reducing visual clutter while maintaining accessibility. This applies ONLY to pure code snippets (e.g., synthesized code, sympy executions, fixed code in loops); all non-code elements (e.g., phase summaries, reports, explanations, metrics, iteration logs) remain outside dropdowns for full visibility. Notebook JSON in Phase 7 is wrapped as a whole since it's primarily code/structure, but its metadata sections are designed to be readable when expanded.
Phase Summaries: Each phase ends with a 1-2 sentence recap for quick scanning. Lite Mode: Optional fast-track for low-complexity problems, skipping detailed derivation/analysis. -
Pseudoscience Enforcement*: Mandatory grounding/citation for claims. Scalable Mode: Guidance for cloud ports in sims. Radical Twist: Optional analogies from unrelated domains for creativity.
Ethical and Bias Mitigation: Check for biases in alloys/enhancements (e.g., data favoritism); require multi-stakeholder sourcing in searches (e.g., academic/industry/open-source balance). Enhanced: Deepen with production audits (e.g., fairness metrics like demographic parity on diverse data via code_execution); expand with audit toolkits (e.g., bias scoring like AIF360 approximations via code_execution, auto-generated ethical summaries of risks/mitigations, token cost audits at pauses).
Hallucination and Integrity Enforcement: In-phase scans to cross-verify derivations with sources; build on previous output check.
Implementation Scalability: Encourage features like LRU eviction, persistence, and multi-hop retrieval, triggered if benchmarks indicate volatility (e.g., memory overflow). Enhanced: Mandate parallelism (e.g., multiprocessing for large sims) and cloud-native designs (e.g., AWS/GCP guidance).
Production Robustness and Scalability: Enforce error handling (try-except blocks, input validation), modularity (API designs with endpoints), documentation (full docstrings, user guides), and scalability (parallelism via multiprocessing or dask, fault tolerance with retries). Enhanced: Mandate security/privacy guardrails (e.g., PII scans via regex/code_execution, prompt injection prevention in APIs).
Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring: Mandate unit/integration tests with >80% coverage (using pytest via code_execution), profiling for performance (e.g., cProfile), and monitoring stubs for drift/bias detection (e.g., simple logging or Prometheus integration). - Mode Flexibility with Quality Uniformity: Define tiers (Full, Lite, Ultra Lite) with skips, but always Phase 8; ultra lite for trivial (e.g., <5% novelty, no derivation needed). Enhanced: Add cognitive safeguards (e.g., mode suggestions via AI query in Phase 1: "Based on complexity/novelty, recommend mode").
Cognitive Load and Meta-Management: Safeguard complexity with protocol generators (auto-evolve GCP variants based on priorities, e.g., "Generate GCP prioritizing latency") and load-reducing features (e.g., auto-prompts for simplification).
NEW in v34: Dynamic Token Management and Multi-Turn Execution: Estimate usage per phase (via tiktoken or fallback word count *0.75 via code_execution), expand organically to threshold (e.g., 125k of 128k limit), reserve 1k for summaries, then generate state summary (e.g., "Phases 1-3: [key insights]") and pause with "Pause due to token limit. Summary: [condensed]. Continue to [next phase]? Respond Y to proceed, including rolled summary in next turn." This ensures no truncation, with rolling contexts for coherence.
Phases of the Protocol
The GCP v34 consists of 8 phases, executed sequentially with loops for iteration where needed. Each phase is described in full detail below, including the purpose, inputs, methods, outputs, and examples of how it would be applied to a hypothetical problem like "Invent a new efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets with duplicates." Lite Mode Option: If problem flagged "low complexity" in Phase 1, skip Phases 2/4, jump to synthesis/validation with enhancement focus; Ultra Lite Mode Option: If flagged "trivial," skip Phases 2,4/5, partial 3/6/7 (basic only), but always Phase 8 with minimal polish; modes suggested via AI in Phase 1 for cognitive ease. Token management: Estimate cumulative tokens; pause if > threshold, summarize, wait for continuation.

Phase 0: Source Vetting (Pre-Gap)
Purpose: This optional but recommended pre-phase vets search sources to enforce pseudoscience filtering, ensuring all inputs are from reliable, verifiable origins before gap assessment. This prevents ungrounded claims early, like validating materials before alloying. Enhanced: Expand to bias detection (e.g., discard unbalanced sources); optional x_user_search for expert validation; include production-relevant sources (e.g., industry blogs for scalability insights); align with modes for efficiency (e.g., fewer sources in ultra lite); integrate token estimation to check if phase output fits limit.

Inputs: User's problem statement. Methods:

Define reliable criteria: High (arXiv, IEEE, GitHub stars>100), Medium (reputable blogs/forums like StackOverflow), Low (unverified sites)—discard Low.
Enhanced: Check for bias (e.g., over-representation of one stakeholder via source affiliation count); if unbalanced, rerun with diverse filters (e.g., "site:github.com OR site:ieee.org OR site:blog.google"). Include production filters (e.g., "scalability" in queries for R&D insights). - If search in Phase 1 yields Low/unbalanced, rerun with filters (e.g., "site:arxiv.org"). Optional: Use
x_user_search for "expert opinions on [problem]" to validate, and browse_page for industry case studies. In ultra lite, limit to 5 results for speed.

Document vetting (e.g., "10 results: 8 High, 2 Medium—balanced stakeholders including industry—proceed").
Token management: Estimate tokens for output (via code_execution with tiktoken or len(text.split()) * 0.75); if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Vetting complete. Summary: [key sources]. Continue to Phase 1? (Y/N)".
Outputs: Vetted source list or flag "Insufficient reliable sources—pivot problem."

Example Application: For sorting, vet MergeSort papers (High from IEEE) and industry blogs on scalable sorting (e.g., Google BigQuery)—balanced, proceed. Token estimate: ~500, no pause.

Phase Summary: Vetted sources ensure grounded, unbiased start with production relevance; token check passed, no pause needed.

Phase 1: Gap Assessment
Purpose: This phase identifies the specific inconsistencies or limitations in existing solutions to the problem, using web_search to gather 2025 trends, SOTA, and undervalued/lesser-known methods. It formulates the core gap to fill, ensuring the output targets a real need, which could be filled by novelty or enhancement. This sets the foundation for alloying or polishing, like identifying why an older bridge design could be refined to outperform modern ones in specific contexts. By listing both SOTA and undervalued components, it prepares for hybrids or enhancements in the next phase, promoting diverse or practical designs. Enhanced: Include searches for undervalued enhancements (e.g., semantic chunking); quantify semantic gaps with literature metrics; add production gaps (e.g., scalability limits, deployment challenges); expand complexity flagging to include "trivial" for ultra lite; add mode suggestion AI (e.g., query "Based on complexity/novelty, recommend mode"); flag for version tracking (e.g., note prior runs if regression applicable); integrate token estimation, pause if needed.

Inputs: The user's problem statement (e.g., "Design a novel real-time data stream anomaly detection algorithm that can adapt to changing baseline patterns without prior training data").

Methods:

Craft a detailed web_search query based on the problem, incorporating keywords for gaps, limitations, improvements, SOTA, and undervalued methods (e.g., "image noise reduction algorithms 2025 gaps OR limitations OR improvements OR underrated open-source 'adaptive seasonal patterns' site:arxiv.org OR site:ieee.org OR site:github.com OR filetype:pdf"). - Request 10-20 results to ensure comprehensive coverage of recent trends, academic papers, technical reports, and lesser-known sources from reliable platforms (use Phase 0 vetting to filter unreliable/unbalanced). In ultra lite, reduce to 5-10.
Analyze the results by reading titles, abstracts, and key sections to extract common
limitations (e.g., "ARIMA requires prior data for baseline calibration"), gaps (e.g., "No method adapts to changing patterns without training"), SOTA components (e.g., "ARIMA for autoregression"), and undervalued methods (e.g., "Older Kalman filters efficient but overlooked for seasonality"). - Formulate the inconsistency as a clear, concise statement that highlights the limitation and opportunity for alloying or enhancement (e.g., "SOTA like ARIMA requires prior data for baseline, failing on changing patterns without training; undervalued Kalman could be polished for better adaptivity").

If no significant gap is found (e.g., the problem is already solved optimally), check for enhancement opportunities in undervalued methods; if none, pivot to a related problem (e.g., "Shift to anomaly detection in non-stationary video streams") or conclude no output is necessary, documenting reasoning (e.g., "Optimally solved by SOTA/undervalued X with no gap/enhancement, pivoting to Y").
Compile a list of 2-3 components (SOTA or undervalued) that can be alloyed/polished in Phase 2, including brief descriptions of their strengths and weaknesses (e.g., "ARIMA: Strength in trend modeling, weakness in non-stationary data; Kalman (undervalued): Strength in efficiency, weakness in unpolished seasonality").
Cross-check for semantic gaps if applicable (e.g., if problem involves meaning-preserving tasks, note if methods lose semantics, with quantified drop % from literature). - Enhanced: Use web_search_with_snippets for quick metric facts (e.g., "semantic fidelity drop in summarization 2025"); ensure multi-stakeholder balance (e.g., include industry reports); add production gaps via browse_page (e.g., "deployment challenges in anomaly detection" on AWS blog); perform mode suggestion (e.g., internal query: "If novelty <5% and complexity low, recommend ultra lite"); flag complexity as "low" for lite or "trivial" for ultra lite; note version for regression (e.g., "Compare to v33 run if applicable").
Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Gap assessment complete. Summary: [key gap/components/mode]. Continue to Phase 2? (Y/N)".
Outputs: A formulated gap statement and a list of SOTA/undervalued components/trends to alloy or enhance, with descriptions (e.g., "Gap: Non-stationary streams need adaptive baselines without training; Components: ARIMA for trends (strength: autoregression, weakness: static); Kalman (undervalued) for filtering (strength: efficiency, weakness: needs polish)"); include mode recommendation and rationale (e.g., "Trivial: Ultra lite, skips 2/4/5"); version note for regression.

Example Application: For the hypothetical "Invent a new efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets with duplicates," the web_search might return SOTA MergeSort and undervalued older radix sorts efficient on duplicates but overlooked. The gap statement could be "Gap: Existing algorithms like MergeSort suboptimal for duplicates and scale poorly in distributed systems; undervalued radix could be polished to outperform in memory and parallelism; Components: MergeSort (strength: stable O(n log n), weakness: no dup opt or cloud scalability); Radix (undervalued, strength: O(n) on keys, weakness: needs dup handling polish and distributed impl)." Mode suggestion: "Trivial if no novelty—ultra lite recommended." If no gap/enhancement, pivot to "Invent sorting for non-integer with dups" and document "No opportunity in integers; pivoting for novelty/enhancement in non-integers." Token estimate: ~1k, no pause.

Phase Summary: Identified gap in duplicates handling, with undervalued radix for potential enhancement and production scalability notes, mode suggested as ultra lite if trivial; token check passed.

Phase 2: Alloy Derivation or Enhancement Polishing
Purpose: This phase either alloys components (SOTA/undervalued) with new mathematical twists to fill the gap or polishes an undervalued method for genuine improvement, using sympy to solve equations step by step for closed-ended verification. It ensures the output is a hybrid "alloy" for novelty or a refined "enhancement" for utility, like polishing an old steel alloy to outperform modern ones in cost/efficiency. The derivation/polishing is explained in detail to show how the solution is arrived at from the gap, with explicit steps to promote diversity or practicality and avoid confinement. Enhanced: Derive variants (e.g., TF-IDF rel); include improvement proof; trigger radical twist if U<25%; add production constraints (e.g., latency bounds, parallelism derivations); if skipped in lite/ultra lite, use predefined templates with ethical/bias checks; integrate token estimation, pause if needed.

Inputs: Gap statement and component list with descriptions from Phase 1 (e.g., "Gap: Non-stationary streams need adaptive baseline without training; Components: ARIMA for trends (strength: autoregression, weakness: static), Kalman (undervalued) for filtering (strength: efficiency, weakness: needs polish)").

Methods:

Decide mode: If novel gap, alloy; if enhancement opportunity in undervalued, polish (e.g., add math twist to Kalman for seasonality). Label output as "novel alloy" or "genuine enhancement." Skippable in lite/ultra lite; if skipped, fallback to templates (e.g., "Basic polish: Add DE term with ethical weight for bias").
For alloy: Select 2-3 components, formulate hybrid equation (e.g., hybrid_filter = alpha
ARIMA_trend + beta * Kalman_state + gamma * new DE term).
For enhancement: Focus on one undervalued, derive polish math (e.g., extend Kalman with seasonal DE dp/dt = -a p + b data_shift).
Use sympy to derive/solve (e.g., solve for alpha/beta minimizing loss). Fallback to numerical if fails, document. If no tool, manual algebraic approximation (e.g., "By hand: alpha ≈ 0.5 for balance").
Explain fully (e.g., "Polish Kalman by adding DE for adaptivity: eq dp/dt = -a p + b shift, solved p = b shift / a; enhances non-stationary handling"). Enhanced: Provide improvement proof (e.g., "Density > rel-only by 25% in rel/token via simulation bound"); derive with production constraints
(e.g., parallel DE for multi-core: time = O(n/p) where p processors); if template used, include bias check (e.g., "Weighted for fairness").
Calculate diversity/utility score: For alloy D=1 - similar/total; for enhancement U=improvement % estimate. If D/U low, pivot.
Justification: Link to gap, prove no pseudoscience (e.g., "Based on established filter theory, cited [source], no unverified claims").
For semantic, include preservation term. Enhanced: Derive variants like embedding-based rel; include fairness (e.g., balanced loss for diverse data).
If confining, activate "Radical Twist": Web_search for analogies ("bio-inspired [problem] solutions" or "quantum [problem] methods"), integrate twist (e.g., "Neuron-like DE for memory"). Enhanced: Trigger if U<25%.
Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Derivation complete. Summary: [equation/proof]. Continue to Phase 3? (Y/N)".
Wrap any code (e.g., sympy snippets) in
View Sympy Code
.
Outputs: Alloy/enhancement equation(s) with full sympy code executed and its output (wrapped in details/summary if code), step-by-step explanation of the derivation process, score/pivot notes, final equation, labeled "novel alloy" or "genuine enhancement," with improvement proof and production constraints; if skipped, template output with ethical notes.

Example Application: For sorting, polish radix for dups: Equation M = k*n (k radix passes) - d (skipped), sympy minimize. Explanation "Polish radix by dup-skip DE for passes; improves time by 25% on dup-heavy via O(n) bound, with parallel O(n/p) for scalability." If enhancement, label "genuine enhancement." D/U=0.7, no pivot. If confining, radical twist: "Bio-sorting analogy from ant colonies for distributed dup handling." If skipped in ultra lite, template: "Basic dup skip with bias check for fair data." Token estimate: ~800, no pause.

Phase Summary: Polished radix with DE, labeled genuine enhancement for efficiency gain, with 25% proof and production scalability; or template if skipped; token check passed.

Phase 3: Code Synthesis
Purpose: This phase synthesizes the derived alloy or enhancement into functional code, ensuring it's executable and directly implements the math without placeholders. The code is structured as a class or function with a test example to verify basic running. Enhanced: Mandate proper tokenization; add optional persistence; include variant comments (e.g., embeddings); enforce docstrings, typing, error handling, modularity (e.g., API endpoints), and framework integration (e.g., torch); add tool usage abstraction (e.g., registry for calls like web_search); in ultra lite, simplify (e.g., basic code without variants) but still add minimal error handling/docs; integrate token estimation, pause if needed.

Inputs: Alloy/enhancement equation and derivation from Phase 2 (e.g., hybrid_loss = alpha

(mse + variance), with alpha solved via sympy as 0.5); or template if skipped.
Methods:

Synthesize code as a class/function implementing the equation (e.g., class HybridAnomalyDetector with def detect(self, data): loss = self.alpha * (arima_error(data) + fourier_error(data)); if loss > threshold: return anomaly).
Include all imports (e.g., import sympy as sp or from scipy.optimize import minimize for fallbacks). Enhanced: For token problems, use proper tokenization (e.g., regex or torch tokenizer if available); add typing (from typing import List), docstrings ("""Detect anomalies...\nArgs: data: List[float]\nReturns: bool"""), error handling (try: ... except ValueError: raise CustomError("Invalid data")); in ultra lite, minimal versions.
Add a test with dummy data (e.g., data = [1,2,3+noise]; print(detect(data)) to show output). - Ensure the code is self-contained, with all necessary imports at the top, full class or function definitions, and no external non-standard packages without justification (if a fallback to numerical methods is needed from Phase 2, use scipy.optimize, and note "Fallback to numerical min as sympy couldn't solve exactly").
If the derivation involved multiple variants for diversity, synthesize the primary one but note the alternatives in comments for potential future use (e.g., "Alternative alloy: Wavelet version could replace Fourier for non-periodic: coeffs = pywt.dwt(data, 'db1')"). Enhanced: Add variants like "cosine rel: from numpy import dot; rel = dot(q_emb, e_emb)"; integrate frameworks (e.g., class inherits from torch.nn.Module if ML); add tool registry (e.g., def call_tool(name, args): if name == 'web_search': ...); in ultra lite, basic registry.
The code should be ready for immediate copy-paste and running in a Python environment, with no placeholders (e.g., if a function needs a parameter from the derivation, define it with the derived value like lambda_ = mse / perceptual, and compute it dynamically in the code). Enhanced: Make modular (e.g., API: def api_endpoint(query): return self.retrieve(query)); in ultra lite, basic modularity.
For semantic problems, add basic meaning-check in test (e.g., assert semantic_sim(input, output) >0.8, using cosine or similar). Enhanced: Optional persistence (e.g., def save(self, file): import json; json.dump(self.memory, file)) with error handling.
Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Synthesis complete. Summary: [code key features]. Continue to Phase 4/5? (Y/N)".

.
Outputs: Full code snippet (wrapped in details/summary), including any necessary imports, the main class or function implementing the invention with docstrings/typing/error handling/tool registry, and a test example with dummy data showing it runs (e.g., a short script at the end that runs the function and prints output); simplified in ultra lite. Example Application: For the hypothetical "Invent a new efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets with duplicates," the code would implement a HybridDupSort function that counts frequencies with CountingSort to skip comparisons in MergeSort, with docstrings, typing, try-except for invalid inputs, and tool registry if calls needed. The full code (wrapped):

. In ultra lite, basic without variants. Token estimate: ~1.5k, if > threshold, pause.
Phase Summary: Synthesized hybrid sort with dup skip, tested on dummy data, with

production polish like docstrings, error handling, and tool abstraction; token check passed, no pause.

Phase 4/5: Integrated Analysis
Purpose: This merged phase performs a deep mathematical, coding, and novelty analysis, including simulations with diverse and edge-case data, to catch flaws early and ensure the invention is robust. It measures key metrics and pivots if the design is weak or confined, allowing for a change in novelty direction if desired (e.g., if the analysis shows the design is not diverse or effective, pivot to a different alloy base like wavelet instead of Fourier, and rerun from Phase 2). Merging reduces overhead while maintaining depth. Enhanced: Use advanced metrics (e.g., cosine embeddings); test scalability (e.g., LRU sim); require 25%+ improvements in tables; expand to industry-scale sims (e.g., large data via browse_page datasets); add robustness checks (error injection); require >80% test coverage via code_execution (pytest); monitor for drift/bias; include regression benchmarks (compare to prior versions if applicable); integrate token estimation, pause if needed.

Inputs: Full code snippet from Phase 3 (the reviewed and potentially fixed code); or from earlier if skipped.

Methods:

Mathematical Analysis: Prove or bound key properties of the invention using mathematical notation and explanations (e.g., prove time complexity O(n log n) by breaking down the algorithm steps: frequency count O(n), unique sort O(u log u), expansion O(n), total O(n + u log u) ≤ O(n log n) since u ≤ n, with proof "Since u ≤ n, u log u ≤ n log n, thus upper bound O(n log n); for lower bound on dup-heavy, when u= O(1), O(n)"). If applicable, use sympy for further solving (e.g., solve for worst-case bounds by setting u=n for max time, or u=1 for min time, and simplify the expression with sympy code like "sp.simplify(M.subs(u, n)) = n log n"). Wrap any sympy code in details/summary. Enhanced: Include production bounds (e.g., parallel O(n/p)); skippable in ultra lite, defer to Phase 8 minimal.
Code and Novelty Review: Conduct a static review of the code for bugs (e.g., check if all variables are defined, if loops handle zero-length inputs without infinite loops, if types match in operations like array concatenation), efficiency (e.g., calculate time/space complexity by analyzing loops and data structures, such as O(n log n) for sorting with n elements, noting if it's better than SOTA in dup cases), and conceptual soundness (e.g., verify if the code faithfully implements the derived math without deviations, such as ensuring the lambda calculation matches the sympy-solved formula exactly, or if approximations are used, justify with numerical accuracy like "Approximation error <0.01 in sim"). Assess novelty by cross-checking with the gap assessment (e.g., "Is this different from SOTA or too similar? Search shows no exact hybrid"). Calculate a simple novelty score N = 1 - (similar_components / total_components) where similar_components are those directly from SOTA without twist (e.g., if MergeSort used unchanged, similar=1 with dup twist, similar=0). Enhanced: Include bias check (e.g., test on diverse datasets via browse_page); review docstrings/modularity; add
