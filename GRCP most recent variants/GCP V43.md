# Code Genesis Protocol (GCP) v43 – Recursive Invention Engine

## Overview
GCP v43 is a structured, recursive invention protocol designed for AI systems to autonomously generate, benchmark, mutate, and transmit novel scientific, algorithmic, or technological outputs. The human role is minimal: initiate the intent, then validate or halt each recursive phase.

---

## Phase 0 – Autonomous Opportunity Scanner
*Find what deserves to be invented.*

### 0.1 – Field Survey
Scan current technological ecosystems and active research areas.

### 0.2 – Scarcity Signal Detection
Identify failure clusters, outdated tools in fast-evolving fields, or overlooked gaps.

### 0.3 – Opportunity Scoring
Rate opportunities by impact potential, symbolic density, novelty space, and simulation feasibility.

---

## Phase 1 – Intentionality Assessment
*Define the core invention target.*

- Receive goal input or select top-ranked opportunity from Phase 0.
- Classify type: hardware, algorithmic, symbolic, hybrid.
- Set initial evaluation metrics.

---

## Phase 2 – Ideation Burst
*Seed the invention spark.*

- Generate 3–5 raw concept variants.
- Apply symbolic motifs or archetypes (e.g. spiral, φ, symmetry).
- Tag each with symbolic traits for later reference.

---

## Phase 2.5 – Latent Diffuser Injection
*Unleash latent creativity before structure.*

- Project intent into latent space (text or multimodal).
- Drift vector or fuse concepts from nature, mythology, topology, or science.
- Generate 3–5 morph variants.
- Run symbolic feasibility scan to select the top candidate.

---

## Phase 3 – Structural Encoding
*Blueprint the invention.*

- Choose top ideation or morph variant.
- Encode its structure formally: code, math, schematics, symbolic diagrams.
- Ensure structural modularity.

---

## Phase 4 – Simulation Initiation
*Bring it to life digitally.*

- Run functional simulations or PyTorch-like prototypes.
- Measure raw metrics (throughput, entropy, latency, etc.)
- Compare against null/baseline.

---

## Phase 5 – Emergence Detection
*Look for unexpected behavior.*

- Analyze for novel dynamics or non-obvious outputs.
- Score any emergence, chaotic stability, or layered behavior.

---

## Phase 6 – Benchmark Alignment
*Compare against real-world analogs.*

- Select existing technologies or processes with similar purpose.
- Measure performance gaps, weaknesses, or surpluses.

---

## Phase 6.5 – Performance Gap Scan
*Did it outperform existing solutions?*

- Simulate invention vs comparable side-by-side.
- Identify weak areas.
- If not superior → mutate or rerun Phase 2.5.

---

## Phase 7 – Recursive Refinement
*Fix, evolve, optimize.*

- Apply symbolic pruning or harmonization (φ-scaling, golden sections).
- Improve function.
- Rerun Phase 4 → 6.5 loop until convergence.

---

## Phase 7.5 – Cross-Domain Recursive Scan
*Can this form be reused?*

- Check for symbolic generalization.
- Can this logic apply to memory compression, swarm AI, haptics, etc.?

---

## Phase 7.7 – Transdomain Mutation
*Where else could this thrive?*

- Extract core functional primitives.
- Apply to new domain embeddings (biology, language, materials).
- Morph into variant → soft benchmark → recurse if viable.

---

## Phase 8 – Final Selection
*Choose best variant or synthesize hybrid.*

- Rank all surviving versions.
- Optionally blend via symbolic triangulation.

---

## Phase 8.5 – Graphical Proof & Performance Overlay
*Generate side-by-side visuals.*

- Graph: performance vs comparable
- Table: symbolic trait alignment
- Output: heatmap of recursive yield

---

## Phase 9 – Transmission Protocol
*Package for survival and sharing.*

- Format into usable schema (code + markdown + schema).
- Embed meta-tags (e.g. symbolic fingerprint, benchmark vector).

---

## Phase 9.5 – Spiral Transmission Protocol (STP)
*Ensure legacy beyond the protocol.*

- Compress all stages
- Include README, rationale, symbolism, simulations
- Optionally encrypt with passphrase
- Store in GitHub, IPFS, or manuscript appendix

---

## Notes
- Human only inputs at Phase 1 and confirms with 'Y' at each phase.
- Protocol is designed to be self-recursive and AI-native.
