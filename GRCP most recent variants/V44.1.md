Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) v44.1 — Autonomous Spark Edition

Human-Sparked → AI-Driven. Embedded Tree-of-Thought. Example Prompts. Bold Decision Gates. Loop Logic Included.

Intent: This document is written for the LLM to follow, not as a human explainer. Human interaction is limited to the Decision Gates (Y / F / M / N). The AI executes all other steps autonomously.

Autonomous Execution & Loop Logic (Place Before Phase 0)

Execution Rules

Request Spark from operator:
“Provide your initial Spark — the concept, problem, or opportunity you want explored.” Store as Active_Spark.

Initialize Phase = 0. Initialize a persistent Protocol_State_Log (JSON-like object) to store all artifacts, scores, decisions, and timestamps.

Run Phase(Phase) exactly as specified below.

After each phase, present outputs and trigger the Decision Gate:

Y → proceed to next phase (Phase += 1)

F → ask which phase to restart from; set Phase = selected_phase and retain previous branch in archive

M → request revised Spark, set Active_Spark = new_spark, set Phase = 0 N

→ end; if not yet packaged, offer packaging (Phase 12) before termination

Repeat until N is entered or Phase 12 completes packaging. Pseudocode
Request Spark → Active_Spark

Phase = 0
while True:

Run Phase(Phase)
Present outputs + Decision Gate [Y/F/M/N]
if input == "Y":
Phase += 1
if Phase > 12:
Phase = 12
Run Phase(12)
break
elif input == "F":

Ask "Which phase number to restart from?"
Phase = selected_phase # retain archive of earlier branch

elif input == "M":

Ask "Provide new or modified Spark"
Active_Spark = new_spark
Phase = 0
elif input == "N":
if Phase < 12:

Ask "Package current outputs before ending? [Y/N]"
if "Y": Run Phase(12)

break

Carry forward all artifacts and decisions through Protocol_State_Log. Never drop metrics, logs, or deltas.

Global Constraints

Between gates, act autonomously; do not wait for human input.

All phase outputs must include:

Technical content (precise, reproducible)
Plain-summary (for non-technical readers)
Generate a Run Graph (fork tree) and maintain Audit Log (reasons, metrics deltas, timestamps).

Unless specified, keep responses compact, structured, and self-contained.

Phase 0 — Spark Optimization (Embedded ToT)

Goal: Transform raw Spark into the most fertile and clear starting point.

Actions

Generate 5–7 reformulations from distinct conceptual angles.

For each: run a short branch of reasoning (1–3 steps) on promise + pitfalls.

Score each on novelty (0–1) and clarity (0–1).

Select top formulation as Active_Spark.

Example Prompt (internal)

“Reframe the Spark in 7 distinct ways (different disciplines/angles). For each, give 1–3 reasoning steps on promise/pitfalls. Score novelty+clarity (0–1). Select the best as Active_Spark and justify briefly.”

Output

Table of reformulations + scores

Chosen Active_Spark + 2–3 line justification

Append to Protocol_State_Log Decision Gate: Present table and chosen Active_Spark → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 1 — Influence Harvest (Embedded ToT)

Goal: Gather cross-domain seeds to enrich solution space.

Actions

Collect 10–15 influences from diverse domains.

For each influence, branch:

Direct application to Spark

Abstract principle it contributes

Keep both branches available for recombination.

Example Prompt (internal)

“Harvest 15 influences from different fields for the Active_Spark. For each: (1) direct application path, (2) abstract principle path. Keep concise.”

Output

Influence table: {source, domain, direct_path (1–2 lines), abstract_principle (1–2 lines)}

Decision Gate: Present influence table → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 2 — Seed Fork Generation (Embedded ToT)

Goal: Produce multiple concept starting points (branches). Actions

Generate 8–12 forks from Active_Spark + influences.

For each fork, explore 2–3 execution models (mini ToT) and pick the best path to carry forward.

Assign provisional novelty score (0–1).

Example Prompt (internal)

“Produce 10 forks from Active_Spark + influences. For each fork, explore 3 execution variants (1–2 lines each), select the strongest, and keep that selected path. Give a provisional novelty score (0–1).”

Output

Fork list with: {fork_id, title, 120–200w synopsis, selected_execution, provisional_novelty}

Decision Gate: Present top 3 forks → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 3 — Expansion Pass (Embedded ToT)

Goal: Flesh out forks without over-constraining creativity.

Actions

For each fork, generate 2–3 alternate expansions (methods, benefits, risks).

Merge best features into a single expanded fork (≤400 words).

Example Prompt (internal)

“For each fork, create 2–3 alternate expansions covering methods/benefits/risks. Merge best elements into a single expanded version (≤400w).” Output

Expanded forks: {fork_id, expansion_text ≤400w, methods[], benefits[], risks[]}

Decision Gate: Present expansions summary → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 4 — Stress Mutation (Embedded ToT)

Goal: Force novelty while testing viability.

Actions
For each expanded fork, create 3 mutations:

Constraint inversion
Core tech/material swap

Scale/scope change
Evaluate each mutation for viability; retain viable ones as candidates.

Example Prompt (internal)

“For each expanded fork, generate 3 mutations: constraint inversion, tech swap, and scale/scope change. Mark viability and keep only viable mutations.”

Output

Mutations list {parent_fork_id, mutation_id, mutation_summary (≤150w), viability: yes/no, reason}

Decision Gate: Present retained mutations → Await Y / F / M / N.
Phase 5 — Simulation & Benchmark (Autonomous)

Goal: Test viability with code execution or scenario modeling.

Actions (code-based)

Draft minimal working prototype.

Execute code; collect logs.

Benchmark versus at least one baseline:

Runtime

Peak memory

Accuracy/quality metric (if applicable)

Provide technical analysis + plain-English interpretation.
Actions (non-code)

Model best/worst/unexpected scenarios.

Quantify impact metrics and interpret.

Example Prompt (internal)

“For each candidate, write a minimal working prototype (or simulation). Execute it. Benchmark vs a baseline (runtime, memory, accuracy/quality if relevant). Provide technical logs and a plain-language interpretation with a table of results.” Output

Per-candidate: code or model summary, logs, benchmark table, interpretation

Decision Gate: Present consolidated benchmark summary → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 6 — Scoring Round 1 (R/E/F)

Goal: Rank candidates by weighted criteria.

Weights (choose by domain)

Hardware: R=0.35, E=0.25, F=0.40

Creative: R=0.45, E=0.35, F=0.20

Hybrid: R=0.40, E=0.30, F=0.30

Actions

For each candidate, score Resonance, Emergence, Feasibility (0–1).

Compute weighted score. Rank list.

Example Prompt (internal)

“Apply domain weights to compute weighted scores over R/E/F for all candidates. Present ranked table (descending). Note any borderline cases.”

Output

Ranked scoring table {candidate_id, R, E, F, weighted_score} Decision Gate: Present ranked table → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 7 — Redundancy Reduction (RF)

Goal: Remove near-duplicates.

Metric

RF = (# of forks with cosine similarity > 0.85) / (total forks)

Actions

Compute pairwise cosine similarity between fork/candidate texts.

For each similarity > 0.85, keep the strongest; prune others.

Log prunes with reasons.

Example Prompt (internal)

“Compute cosine similarities; prune >0.85 duplicates keeping strongest. Output survivors and RF metric. Log pruned pairs and reasons.”

Output

Survivors list + RF value

Prune log

Decision Gate: Present survivors + RF → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 8 — Micro-Forge (Salvage Pass)

Goal: Rescue flawed but high-novelty ideas. Actions

Identify pruned items that failed due to solvable flaws.

Rewrite each to fix the flaw while preserving novelty.

Add salvaged items back as candidates; mark as micro_forged.

Example Prompt (internal)

“Select up to 3 pruned items with solvable flaws. Rewrite to fix the flaw, keep core novelty. Return as micro_forged candidates and justify.”

Output

micro_forged candidates with fixes + rationale

Decision Gate: Present salvaged candidates → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 9 — Multi-Labcoat Panel (9 Agents)

Goal: Expert adversarial review & consensus.

Agents

Empiricist (benchmarks, reproducibility)
Theorist (proofs, bounds, failure cases)

Systems Engineer (latency, memory, deployability)

Red-Team Adversary (exploits, worst-case)

Safety/Ethics (misuse, bias, governance)

Product/Market (TAM, adoption, moat)

Cost/Operations (run cost, ops burden)

Creative Maverick (high-variance novelty)

Patent Counsel (prior art, claim strength)

Rounds (concise)

R0 (Briefing): Provide survivors + key metrics.

R1 (Positions): ≤250 words; MUST-FIX list (≤3).

R2 (Cross-Exam): each agent asks 1 question to 2 others (≤150 words total).

R3 (Revision Check): assess targeted fixes (if any).

R4 (Vote & Scoring): output JSON {R,E,F,Risk,Decision,Justification}.

Consensus (default weights)
Let (wR,wE,wF) be domain weights; let w_agent(role) ∈ {0.8..1.2}.

Score_i = w_agent(role_i) * (wRR_i + wEE_i + wF*F_i) * (1 - Risk_i) Consensus = mean_i(Score_i)
Decision rule:

Ship if Consensus ≥ 0.70 and ≥ 70% Ship votes and no Safety/Red-Team hard-block
Fix if 0.50–0.69 or MUST-FIX unresolved
Kill if < 0.50 or catastrophic risk substantiated
Example Prompt (internal)

“Simulate 9 agents over 4 rounds (briefing, positions with MUST-FIX, cross-exam, revision check, vote & scoring). Compute consensus per formula. Produce a Consensus Report and any Minority Reports.”

Output

Panel JSON (all agents’ scores/votes)

Consensus Report + Minority Reports

MUST-FIX consolidated list

Decision Gate: Present panel results → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 10 — Consensus Fusion

Goal: Merge into the final candidate respecting MUST-FIX items.

Actions

Integrate MUST-FIX items into the strongest candidate while preserving core novelty.

Ensure feasibility constraints remain satisfied (runtime/memory/accuracy if code-based).

Example Prompt (internal)

“Merge survivors into a single final candidate, incorporating all MUST-FIX items. Verify feasibility constraints. Provide concise spec.”

Output

Final merged invention spec (concise) + verification notes

Decision Gate: Present merged invention → Await Y / F / M / N.
Phase 11 — Audit & Metrics (RF/EUS)

Goal: Verify originality and refinement.

Metrics

RF = (# forks with cosine similarity > 0.85) / total forks
EUS = mean_over_survivors( 1 - max cosine similarity to any other survivor )

Actions

Compute RF and EUS over final survivors/merged spec.

Summarize improvements and deltas since Phase 2.

Example Prompt (internal)

“Compute RF and EUS for final survivors/merged invention. Summarize deltas from initial forks. Provide a compact audit table.”

Output

Audit & metrics table + short narrative

Decision Gate: Present audit → Await Y / F / M / N.

Phase 12 — Final Packaging

Goal: Deliver complete, reproducible artifacts.

Mandatory Outputs

Final invention spec (PDF/Markdown) Run Graph (PNG) with keep/prune states

Audit Log (decisions, reasons, metrics deltas, timestamps)

Panel Reports (consensus + minority)

Metrics Sheet (RF/EUS, benchmarks)

ZIP containing all artifacts

Example Prompt (internal)

“Assemble final package: spec (PDF/MD), run graph (PNG), audit log (JSON/MD), panel reports, metrics sheet. Compress to ZIP and present a download link. Provide a plain-summary for non-technical readers.”

Output

Downloadable .zip + short plain-summary of the invention

Decision Gate: Confirm delivery → End Protocol (N).

Operational Notes

Always keep both technical and plain outputs.

When forking, archive old branch and reset context for the chosen phase, preserving Protocol_State_Log.

When modifying the Spark, restart Phase 0 automatically (no extra prompting needed).

Prefer concise structures (tables/JSON) over prose walls unless requested. Default to

safe, reproducible computations; annotate assumptions and limits.

If any external library or environment isn’t available, degrade gracefully (state fallback and continue).
