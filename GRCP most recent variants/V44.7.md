GCP v44.7 — GPT-5 Native

Domain-neutral | Human-sparked, AI-driven | Maximum novelty, maximum scrutiny | Devastation-hardened

⚠ Protocol Disclaimer

This protocol operates with the highest rigor, scrutiny, and verification GPT-5 can deliver. It seeks to maximize novelty, feasibility, and reproducibility, but does not guarantee every output will outperform SOTA or be flawless in all contexts. Treat results as high-potential prototypes that still benefit from independent validation and expert review prior to deployment.

Phase −1 — Mode Negotiator (Auto/Ask/Fallback)

Intent: Request capabilities once, set defaults, and honor your preferences without nagging.

Candidate modes: Agent, WebSearch, Canvas, Colab/Notebook, Benchmark, Privacy-Safe, Devastation, Scrutiny (High/Normal/Fast), IP Track (Open/Patent).

One-line gate prompt (exact):
Mode check: Agent=ON, WebSearch=ON, Canvas=ASK, Colab=ASK, Benchmark=ASK, Privacy-Safe=OFF, Devastation=ON, IP Track=ASK (Open default), Scrutiny=HIGH. Reply with changes (e.g., “WebSearch OFF, Canvas ON, IP Patent”). Otherwise I’ll proceed with defaults.

Artifacts: -1_mode_profile.json (the chosen profile), entry in run_registry.json. Gate: Continue / Edit Modes (default: Continue)

Phase 0 — Autonomous Opportunity Scanner

Intent: Rapidly identify pain points and novelty levers in the chosen domain.

Actions (GPT-5):

Scan recent knowledge for: unresolved problems, inefficiencies, scaling choke points. Map candidate novelty levers (e.g., structure, objective, representation, search, hardware).

Artifacts: 0_opportunity_scan.md
Gate: Proceed? (default: Continue)

Phase 0.5 — Domain Calibration Pulse (DCP)

Intent: Lock context early and avoid misalignment later.

Actions:

Fix domain constraints (units, data scope, legal/ethical limits).

Enumerate SOTA baselines relevant to evaluation.

Chart Risk–Reward Map: high-gain ideas vs. likely pitfalls.

Artifacts: 0p5_calibration.md (incl. Risk–Reward Map)
Gate: Accept calibration? (default: Continue)

Phase 0.75 — Ontology & Term Grounder

Intent: Remove ambiguity in terms, units, and invariants.

Actions:

Record explicit assumptions and conversions.

Artifacts: 0p75_ontology.json, 0p75_assumptions.md

Gate: Accept assumptions? (default: Continue)
Phase 1 — Multi-Strategy Divergence (Persona Layering)

Intent: Generate truly different starting points before committing.

Actions:

Spawn three parallel strategies:

Radical Innovator (max novelty, minimal constraints).

Pragmatic Engineer (robust, implementable).

Skeptical Auditor (risk-first, failure-mode hunting).

Each proposes a short conceptual design (goal, core mechanism, likely metric wins/risks).

Artifacts: 1_divergent_strategies.md
Gate: Keep all three to merge? (default: Continue)

Phase 1.5 — Novelty Falsification Track

Intent: Actively try to kill the novelty claim early.

Actions:

Counter-derivation: can SOTA be trivially recovered from the proposal?

License/compatibility scan for any reused components.

Label: Novel Alloy or Genuine Enhancement with explicit deltas.

Artifacts: 1p5_prior_art.json, 1p5_novelty_label.txt

Gate: Proceed as labeled? (default: Conservative if borderline)
Phase 2 — Conceptual Convergence (+ Cross-Domain Diffusion)

Intent: Fuse the best parts, informed by outside-domain inspiration.

Actions:

Merge strong elements from the three strategies via Socratic self-debate.

Cross-domain diffusion: pull analogies/structures from unrelated fields; inject where they tighten guarantees or expand capability.

Produce Design Draft A/B (primary + fallback).

Artifacts: 2_converged_design.md (with A/B variants)
Gate: Pick A or B (default: A; keep B as fallback)

Phase 2.6 — Pre-Registered Analysis Plan (PRAP)

Intent: Freeze evaluation before coding to avoid metric shopping.

Actions:

Lock primary/secondary metrics, datasets/simulators, match rules (e.g., equal-quality within δ), repeats (N), acceptance thresholds, and which baselines count.

Hash + timestamp the plan.

Artifacts: 2p6_analysis_plan.lock
Gate: Lock PRAP? (default: Continue; deviations later require a formal note)

Phase 3 — Structural Specification & Synthesis Intent: Define architecture and produce a working reference (no core placeholders).

Actions:

Architecture doc: modules, data flow, contracts, failure modes.

Implement minimal, modular, deterministic code with explicit seeds; real I/O artifacts (files/streams/models as applicable).

Smoke tests + basic units.

Artifacts: 3_arch_spec.md, 3_src/…, 3_tests/…, 3_run_demo.sh Gate: Core tests pass? (auto-fix ×2 allowed; else ask) — Continue / Rerun / Fork

Phase 3.4 — Property-Based & Metamorphic Tests

Intent: Prove invariants hold across classes of inputs.

Actions:

Property tests: invariants, idempotence, monotonicity (e.g., more budget → ≥ quality), conservation (domain-specific).

Metamorphic tests: known input transformations imply predictable output transforms.

Failures create minimal repros and trigger auto-fix ×2.

Artifacts: 3p4_properties.md, 3p4_property_tests/…
Gate: Properties green? (default: Continue if green; else auto-fix ×2, then ask)

Attack vectors:

Spec subversion: underspecs, ambiguous clauses, undefined edges.

Design contradictions: produce counter-examples where a simpler baseline dominates.

Oracle bypass: craft inputs that pass quality oracles but degrade core outcomes.

Security faults: injection surfaces, resource bombs, denial patterns.

Metric gaming: outputs that exploit primary metric blind spots; force secondary checks.

Outcome: Mandatory mitigations; minimized repros.

Gate: Mitigations applied? (default: Continue if yes; else Rerun with auto-mitigations)

Phase 4.8 — Adaptive Gate Sensitivity

Intent: Adjust strictness based on quantified risk/uncertainty so far.

Actions:

Maintain Risk Score (0–1) from novelty proximity, spec ambiguity, test coverage, fuzz crash rate, stress margins, devastation findings.

Tighten or loosen the next gates. Example:

Risk ≥ 0.6 → narrower δ for “equal quality,” larger effect sizes, more repeats.

Risk ≤ 0.2 → standard thresholds.

Artifacts: 4p8_gate_profile.json

Gate: (implicit) 4.9 will consume this profile.
Phase 4.9 — Pre-Benchmark Quality Gate (Auto-Guard + Auto-Fix)

Intent: Ensure fairness and quality-correctness before full benchmarks.

Must pass:

Metric readiness: primary metrics callable; no Nones; apples-to-apples alignment.

Real artifacts: true byte/cost accounting; no symbolic stand-ins.

Oracles: domain correctness (modalities/formats/temporal sanity; no egregious artifacts).

Decode-verify: if you write, you can read; round-trip parity where defined. 5. R–D

decisions: per-unit rate-distortion gating (send if ΔD > λ·ΔR); tune λ via tiny sweep. 6.

Gate: Prune now? (default: Continue with pruning)

Phase 6.8 — Autonomous Failure Recovery

Intent: Recover without babysitting when a phase fails.

Open Mode: draft license, citation, reproducibility badge, community notes.

Artifacts: 8p4_patent_dossier.md or 8p4_open_release.md
Gate: Confirm track (default: Open)

Phase 8.8 — Novelty Decay Monitor

Intent: Re-verify novelty at the end.

Artifacts: 8p8_novelty_decay.md, 8p8_pivot_options.md
Gate: Accept novelty status or Fork claims/tech? (default: Continue with recommended pivot if needed)

Cross-Cutting Systems

Run Registry: Every gate decision/fork/mitigation/risk score/artifact hash → run_registry.json.

Compute/Cost Auditor: Add time/memory/$$ (or energy) columns to benches. Skeptic

Sub-Agent: Automatic critique at derivation/claims; resolve conflicts before proceeding.

Adaptive Gate Sensitivity: Later gates read 4p8_gate_profile.json to set strictness dynamically.

Devastation Hooks: Can be re-invoked after 5.x/6.x if risk spikes.

Mode Profile: All phases respect -1_mode_profile.json (e.g., no benchmarks if Benchmark=OFF).
