regression (e.g., "Compared to v33: +10% coverage").

Simulations: Run the code with varied data sets, including edge cases to test robustness (e.g., empty input to check for errors or correct handling like returning empty output; large
input with n=1000 elements to check scalability and time; noisy or random data to check if the algorithm handles variability well; worst-case data like all duplicates for sorting to check if the optimization triggers correctly). Use code_execution tool if needed for verification, but simulate in reasoning if tool limits apply (e.g., for large n, estimate time based on complexity and small-scale tests). For each simulation, record the inputs (e.g., "Input: arr = []"), outputs (e.g., "Output: []"), and performance (e.g., "Time: 0.001s, Memory: 100KB"). Enhanced: Mandate code_execution for timings; test scalability (e.g., LRU if m large, parallelism with multiprocessing); use browse_page for real datasets (e.g., "extract large text corpus from wiki page"); in ultra lite, minimal sims.

Metrics Measurement: Compute relevant metrics for the invention (e.g., compression ratio as len(original)/len(compressed) for compression, accuracy as accuracy_score for classifiers, time as measured seconds for algorithms) and compare to SOTA baseline (e.g., standard K-means time vs. hybrid time on the same data, with code for the baseline included in the simulation to run side-by-side). Use numerical values and describe any plots or tables (e.g., "Simulation on n=100 to 1000 shows time O(n log n) curve vs. SOTA O(n^2), with table: n=100 time=0.01s invention vs 0.1s SOTA"). Enhanced: For semantic, use advanced (e.g., cosine via numpy/torch embeddings, ROUGE approx); require tables showing 25%+ gain; add production metrics (latency under load, cost via estimates); include regression table (e.g., "v33 vs v34:
15% fidelity").
For semantic domains, add meaning-preservation sims (e.g., compute semantic similarity via cosine on embeddings; if <80%, flag "Semantic degradation" and pivot). Cross-check outputs for "naive" patterns (e.g., repetitive dummies → "Naive regen detected, pivot required"). Enhanced: Include fairness (e.g., disparate impact <1.2).
Add pseudoscience scan: Flag unproven claims (e.g., "No citation for H as semantic—pivot or cite"). Enhanced: Hallucination scan via source cross-verify; add drift sim (e.g., perturb data, check fidelity drop).
Add semantic review if applicable (e.g., "Does output preserve meaning? Check for naive patterns like repeated averages → flag 'Naive impl: Pivot for better regen'"). Require tie-back to gap (e.g., "Does DE term directly address non-stationary? Yes/no with justification"). Enhanced: Add robustness review (inject errors, e.g., invalid input via code_execution). - If issues (e.g., poor metrics <15% better, or semantic loss), loop back to Phase 3 for fixes or Phase 2 for pivot. If confining, activate radical twist: Web_search for analogies ("bio-inspired [problem] solutions" or "quantum [problem] methods"), integrate. Enhanced: Pivot if coverage <80% or bias flagged; skippable in ultra lite, defer to Phase 8.
Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Analysis complete. Summary: [bounds/metrics/table]. Continue to Phase 6? (Y/N)".
Outputs: Integrated report with math bounds, code/novelty review, simulation results/tables, metrics comparisons (e.g., "Time: 40% reduction"), pseudoscience flags, and any loop/pivot notes, including production metrics like coverage and latency; regression table if applicable; minimal in ultra lite.

Example Application: For the sorting hypothesis, math bounds O(n log n) with parallel O(n/p), code checks no index errors with try-except, sims: empty [] → [], all dup → O(n), large

n=10^4 → 0.1s vs SOTA 0.2s under load. Metrics: Time reduction 40%, N=0.67, coverage 85%, regression: +5% vs v33. Pseudoscience: None. Semantic N/A, no pivot. Token estimate: ~2k, if > threshold, pause.

Phase Summary: Analysis passed with 40% time gain, no issues, with advanced metrics, >80% coverage, production checks, and regression notes; token check passed.

Phase 6: Validation/Fix Loop
Purpose: Use code_execution tool to test the code with real data, fix any runtime errors or performance issues until it works and is better than SOTA in key metrics. This phase ensures the invention is executable and meets practical standards. Enhanced: Add fixes for chunking/multi-hop; test >85% fidelity; up to 7 iterations if scalability; include concurrency fixes (e.g., threading); validate on real-world data via browse_page; add security/privacy fixes (e.g., PII redaction via regex/code_execution); integrate token estimation, pause if needed.

Inputs: Code from Phase 4/5 (the reviewed and potentially fixed code); or from Phase 3 if skipped.

Methods:

Prepare real or generated data relevant to the problem (e.g., for compression, a sample PDF bytes string with repetitive sections like b"%PDF-1.4\n<> 50\n<< /obj >>"). Enhanced: Use browse_page for real datasets (e.g., "extract text from wiki URL"); in ultra lite, minimal data. - Run the code using code_execution tool, capturing outputs, errors, and performance (e.g., time taken, memory used).
If errors occur (e.g., NameError for missing import, TypeError for mismatch), fix them (e.g., add the import, adjust types to match like convert to bytes), and rerun the test with the fixed code. Wrap fixes in details/summary. Enhanced: Fix for production (e.g., add threading for concurrency if slow; PII scan: import re;
re.sub(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', '[REDACTED]', text)). - Check for correctness in the output (e.g., for compression, verify decompressed == original with print("Extractable:", decompressed == original); for sorting, verify the list is sorted correctly with sorted(arr) == hybrid_dup_sort(arr)).
Measure key metrics and compare to SOTA baseline (e.g., for compression, compute ratio = len(original)/len(compressed) and compare to zlib.compress on the same data with zlib_ratio = len(original)/len(zlib.compress(original))). Enhanced: Include profiling (cProfile.run) for bottlenecks; in ultra lite, basic iterations (max 3).
For semantic tasks, add domain-specific validation (e.g., if text tokens, compute BLEU(decompressed, original)>0.8; if <, fix by improving regen logic or pivot). Enhanced: Use advanced (e.g., cosine >0.85); add chunking/multi-hop fixes if fidelity low; check bias on diverse data.
Loop until no errors, the invention works correctly (e.g., extractable=True for compression), and metrics are better than SOTA (e.g., ratio 1.2x zlib, or time < SOTA by 10%, or semantic fidelity >80%). Enhanced: Max 7 iterations; include scalability tests (e.g.,
large memory with LRU, parallel sims); max 3 in ultra lite.

If unfixable or metrics not better (e.g., ratio < SOTA after 7 fixes), pivot the novelty (e.g., change from phi to wavelet for better efficiency) and rerun from Phase 2, documenting the pivot (e.g., "Pivot: Ratio only 1.1x zlib—switching to wavelet alloy for better pattern detection, rerunning Phase 2").
Document each iteration in the loop (e.g., "Iteration 1: Error: Missing import zlib—fixed by adding import zlib. Ratio: 1.5 > zlib 1.3—success").
Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Validation complete. Summary: [fixes/metrics]. Continue to Phase 7? (Y/N)".
Outputs: Fixed code (wrapped in details/summary if changed), test outputs showing success (e.g., "Ratio: 2.1, Extractable: True"), and iteration log if fixes were needed (e.g., "Iteration 1: Fixed missing import, ratio improved to 1.5"); include PII/security notes.

Example Application: For the sorting hypothesis, prepare data like arr = [1]*100 from browse_page corpus, run code_execution: No error, sorted correctly, time 10% < Timsort on dups with parallel speedup and PII safe. Semantic N/A, no pivot. Token estimate: ~1.2k, no pause.

Phase Summary: Validated sort with fixes, 10% time improvement, fidelity >85% if semantic, with production validation and security/privacy; token check passed.

Phase 7: Benchmarking and Notebook Generation
Purpose: Run comprehensive benchmarks comparing the invention to SOTA baselines, generate a full .ipynb notebook with all code, tests, and results, and finalize the invention if metrics confirm superiority. Enhanced: Add cells for extensions (e.g., multi-hop); mandate

80% fidelity with advanced checks; include "Potential Extensions" section; enrich with unit tests (pytest), profiling cells, deployment guidance (e.g., Docker), and "Production Readiness Report" (scores for robustness/scalability); expand readiness report with ethical summaries, bias scores; in ultra lite, minimal benchmarks (small datasets, basic coverage); integrate token estimation, pause if needed.

Inputs: Validated code from Phase 6.

Methods:

Implement SOTA baseline in code (e.g., import zlib for compression comparison). - Run benchmarks on multiple datasets (e.g., small/medium/large, varied types), measuring metrics (e.g., timeit for time, fidelity for preservation). For large-scale, add Scalable Mode: Guidance for cloud (e.g., "Adapt to Colab/GCP: !pip install dask; use dask.array for parallel sims"). Fallback to subsampling if no cloud. Enhanced: Use code_execution for pytest tests (>80% coverage), cProfile for profiling; in ultra lite, basic.
Generate .ipynb JSON: Sections for intro (gap/alloy), code, tests (edge cases with prints),
benchmarks (timeit, plots with matplotlib), results (prints/tables, improvement %). Enhanced: Add cells for unit tests ("!pytest"), profiling ("import cProfile; cProfile.run('func()')"), ethical discussion, "Potential Extensions" (e.g., query expansion), "Production Readiness Report" (e.g., table: Robustness 90%, Scalability O(n/p), Coverage 85%), "Deployment" (Dockerfile), and "Ethical Summary" (risks like bias, mitigations via AIF360 approx).

For semantic tasks, mandate semantic benchmarks (e.g., ROUGE score > SOTA); ensure notebook checks for naive outputs (e.g., assert not all(regen == mean)). Enhanced: Include bias audits (e.g., fairness library if available, or approx via code).
If metrics not better/novel/useful, loop to Phase 2.
Token management: Estimate tokens for output; if cumulative > threshold, summarize phase and pause: "Pause: Benchmarking complete. Summary: [report/notebook key]. Continue to Phase 8? (Y/N)".

for presentation.
Outputs: Benchmark report with comparisons (e.g., "Time: 0.5s vs. SOTA 1.0s. Novelty: No match. Useful: Yes"), and full .ipynb JSON (wrapped in details/summary); include ethical summary.

Example Application: For sorting, report "Time reduction 40% vs Timsort on 50% dups, coverage 85%". Notebook (wrapped):

with readiness report and ethical summary. Token estimate: ~3k, if > threshold, pause.
Phase Summary: Benchmarked sort with 40% gain, notebook generated with extensions and production report, ethical summary; token check passed.

Phase 8: Production Polish
Purpose: This phase finalizes the invention for production by generating documentation, security audits, monitoring integrations, and deployment artifacts. It ensures the output is deployable in real-world systems, with fault tolerance, maintainability, and monitoring, transforming it from a prototype to a professional R&D-level solution. Enhanced: Universal across modes; add "minimal polish" sub-option for ultra lite (basic docs/logging/security); mandate meta-tracking (changelogs of changes/impacts, e.g., "v33 to v34: Added token management, impact +20% resilience"); auto-gen scaffolds (version folders like gcp_outputs/v34/timestamp, git tags via snippets); ethical expansions (bias toolkits like AIF360 approx via code_execution, token cost audits); security guardrails (injection scans, PII redaction); protocol generator helper (auto-evolve variants, e.g., code_execution prompt: "Generate GCP prioritizing latency"); integrate token estimation, but no pause needed as final.

Inputs: Validated and benchmarked code from Phase 7.

Methods:

Generate full documentation: Add docstrings if missing (via code_execution to prompt insertion), create README.md snippet (e.g., "Usage: pip install reqs; python main.py"), and API guide (e.g., "Endpoint: /sort - POST arr: List[int]"); in minimal for ultra lite, basic README. -
Perform security audits: Check for vulnerabilities (e.g., input sanitization via code_execution: "assert no SQL injection", PII redaction: re.sub patterns), hash collisions in keys, and add fixes (e.g., use secure hash); guard against injection (e.g., validate inputs).

Integrate monitoring: Add logging (import logging; logging.info("Retrieved: %s", ret)), drift detection stub (e.g., def check_drift(old_metric, new): if abs(old - new) > 0.1: alert()), and Prometheus/ELK stubs if applicable; in minimal, basic logging.
Create deployment artifacts: Generate Dockerfile (e.g., "FROM python:3.12\nCOPY . /\nRUN pip install -r reqs.txt\nCMD python app.py"), cloud guidance (e.g., "Deploy to AWS: use ECR for image, ECS for container"), and CI/CD snippet (GitHub Actions yaml for tests); in minimal, basic Docker.
Flag IP: Note patentable elements (e.g., "Novel density twist may be IP-protectable"). - Ethical audit: Run bias checks on production data (e.g., code_execution for fairness metrics like AIF360 approx: disparate impact), generate summary (e.g., "Risks: Token inefficiency; Mitigations: Optimized loops"), include token cost audit (e.g., "Code estimated 500 tokens/run"). - Meta-tracking: Auto-gen changelog (e.g., "Change: Added token management; Impact: +20% resilience; Solved: Truncation issues"); version scaffolds (e.g., "Create folder gcp_outputs/v34/[timestamp] with code/notebook").
Protocol generator: If flagged, auto-evolve (e.g., code_execution: "Based on priorities [latency], generate GCP variant").
If issues (e.g., security flag), loop to Phase 6 for fixes.
In minimal for ultra lite: Basic docs/logging/security, skip advanced.
Token management: As final, no pause; but estimate total for report.
Outputs*: Polished code with docs/monitoring (wrapped if code), README/Dockerfile snippets, readiness report update (e.g., "Security: Passed, Monitoring: Integrated"), ethical summary, meta-changelog, version scaffolds, and final artifacts.
Example Application: For sorting, add logging, Dockerfile, README: "HybridDupSort: Efficient dup sorting.\nInstall: pip install typing\nUse: sorter = HybridDupSort(); sorted_arr = sorter.sort([1,2,1])"; changelog: "v33 to v34: Token management, impact resilience"; ethical: "Risks: Bias in data; Mitigations: Fairness check"; token audit: "~2k total".

Phase Summary: Polished sort for production with docs, monitoring, deployment, ethical summary, and meta-tracking; token management complete, no pause as final.
