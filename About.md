## 🧬 Why I Built the GCP

In a world racing to generate code, I asked:  
**“What if AI could invent — not just write?”**

The Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) was born from that question.  
Not as a novelty, but as a serious tool — a way to *guide AI through the full cycle of invention*.

Over months of testing with GPT, Claude, and Grok, I built GCP to be:
- 🔁 **Recursive** (returns to refine ideas based on benchmarks)
- 🧪 **Scientific** (runs code, simulates, and audits results)
- 🧠 **Socratic** (debates itself and forks divergent thought paths)
- 📊 **Grounded** (asks: “How does this compare to real-world baselines?”)

And now?  
It’s open source. MIT licensed.  
Ready for you to run, test, mutate — or improve.

This isn’t a miracle.  
It’s a forge.

**Who is this for?**
- AI researchers
- Code inventors
- Toolmakers and thinkers
- Anyone tired of gimmicks and ready to teach AI how to *build with intent*

I made the protocol I wish I had when I started.

Now it's yours.
