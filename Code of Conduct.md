# Code of Conduct

> Original policy (no long verbatim blocks). Inspired by the Contributor Covenant (v2.1).

We want the Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) community to be **welcoming, safe, and helpful**. This policy sets clear expectations for how we work together.

## Our Standards

- Be respectful and inclusive. Disagree without personal attacks.
- Use clear, considerate language. Avoid sexualized, demeaning, or hateful content.
- Assume good intent; focus on ideas and evidence.
- Protect privacy and confidentiality; do not disclose sensitive information.
- No harassment, stalking, doxxing, or sustained disruption—online or offline.

## Scope

This Code applies to all community spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, chats, events), project maintainers, and contributors acting on behalf of the project.

## Reporting

- For conduct concerns, open a **private** note to maintainers via GitHub (Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability) or contact the maintainers through the repository admins if needed.
- Do **not** open a public issue for conduct incidents.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including **warnings**, **temporary bans**, or **permanent removal** from project spaces. Repeated or severe violations will result in stronger actions.

## Attribution

This policy is inspired by the spirit of the **Contributor Covenant v2.1**.
