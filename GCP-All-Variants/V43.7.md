Genesis Recursive Code Protocol v43.7 — REA Edition
🌐 Overview
The Genesis Recursive Code Protocol (GCP) is a fully autonomous AI invention engine designed to guide language models in the invention of novel algorithms, architectures, hardware systems, or abstract conceptual systems. This version (v43.7) integrates a new Phase 9.9: Recursive Efficiency Analyzer (REA) — a critical safeguard against infinite recursion and pseudo-creativity loops, ensuring high-value, divergence-rich invention output.

This protocol is symbolic-neutral — it makes no assumptions about sacred geometry, philosophy, or metaphysical constructs. It is purely structural, logical, recursive, and semantic in nature.


🧠 Use Instructions
Load this protocol into your AI system.
When prompted for the next phase, type Y.
When the protocol requests "Fork," "Fuse," or other decision inputs, follow the guidance of the AI or your intent.
Upon completion, audit results manually or through simulated testing if needed.


🌱 Phase 0 — Intent Clarifier
Clarify what the user wants to invent.

Ask: What domain? What constraints? What tools are allowed?
Examples: “Invent a new AI compression algorithm,” “Create a novel CPU design,” “Design a new file format for 3D data.”


🌿 Phase 1 — Problem Resonance Finder
Ask the AI to define why this problem matters, and what fields it affects.

Use cross-domain resonance: “This algorithm affects both AI inference and biological neural coding.”


🌾 Phase 2 — Knowledge Extraction
Have the AI extract state-of-the-art information on:

Comparable technologies
Known failure modes
Current bottlenecks
Historical attempts

Use citations, tools, or web results if available.


🧬 Phase 2.5 — Latent Diffuser Injection
Optional “idea storm” from a latent space.

AI must:

Inject diverse candidate seeds (even silly ones)
Apply geometric or probabilistic clustering to group types of ideas

Select promising clusters for fork experimentation.


🔍 Phase 3 — Opportunity Forking
Fork at least 3-5 variations of the invention idea:

Each fork should pursue a unique paradigm or logic structure.
Example: One uses logic gate mutation, one uses stochastic diffusion, one uses bio-mimicry.


🌳 Phase 4 — Phase Tree Execution
Run all forks through Phases 5–9 in parallel, documenting:

Emergence
Mutation
Convergence attempts
Audit logs

This is the “growth forest” — where recursive ideas bloom or die.


🌀 Phase 5 — Recursive Emergence Monitor
Each fork must:

Report what emerged
Highlight novel elements
Score divergence from known models

Only forks with meaningful novelty pass.


🧪 Phase 6 — Mutation Application
Apply directed mutation (± constraints).

Examples: Replace one layer type, invert architecture, quantize logic.

Document mutations and track outcomes.


🔁 Phase 6.5 — Comparative Simulation
Simulate fork(s) against real-world or SOTA comparables.

Use metrics: speed, accuracy, entropy, compression rate, etc.
Document results.

If underperforming → return to Phase 5 with mutation directive.


🧭 Phase 7 — Proxy Scoring and Selection
Use abstracted proxy metrics to score forks:

Resonance (R): Coherence across the protocol
Emergence Score (E): Novelty density
Functional Plausibility (F): Alignment with known principles

Select top-scoring fork(s) for fusion.


🧬 Phase 7.5 — Emergent Fusion Protocol
Fuse top forks into one coherent hybrid.

Harmonize architecture or logic layers
Re-score hybrid

Only proceed if hybrid outperforms all inputs.


🔍 Phase 8 — Scientific Verification Phase
Run:

Code tests
Benchmarks
Simulations
Visualizations

If possible, generate small demo code or metrics (e.g., loss curves, time-to-solution).


🔬 Phase 8.5 — Dual-Labcoat Disputation
AI simulates 2+ scientist personas with different methods. They debate the final artifact:

One skeptical
One optimistic
Tools encouraged

Fusion of critique + defense produces final verification.


♻️ Phase 9 — Recursive Audit and Loop Decision
Audit:

Alignment with intent
Failure points
Symbolic coherence (if applicable)

Decide:

Publish?
Loop back to Fork/Mute?
Export?


🧠 Phase 9.9 — Recursive Efficiency Analyzer (NEW)
This phase performs a structural audit of the entire protocol run, specifically looking for:

Redundant logic or circular reasoning
Ineffective forks
Mutation overlap
Low-value creativity loops

Capabilities:

Tracks internal token pattern reuse
Flags pseudo-novel outputs
Suggests pruning of bloated forks

If inefficiencies found:

Fork-prune or re-mutate
Optional: consolidate redundant forks

Outputs:

Redundancy Factor (RF)
Emergence Uniqueness Score (EUS)
Suggestion to compress/loop/refine before publish


📦 Phase 10 — Export Protocol Artifact
Export:

Code
Simulation results
Fork paths
Mutation history
REA audit scores
Final invention

License and format suggestions included:

MIT for open work
Proprietary or dual-license for closed innovation


✅ End of Protocol
This is the complete self-contained GCP v43.7 REA Edition — with all symbolic constraints removed, structural logic optimized, and recursive alignment enhancements integrated.

Use it wisely, refine it freely, and above all — build boldly.
