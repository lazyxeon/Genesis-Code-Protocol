Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in GRCP (e.g., in CLI scripts, protocol logic, or dependencies), please report it responsibly:

Do not open a public issue: Use a private channel to avoid exposing risks.
Email the maintainer: Send details to [lazyxeon@example.com] (replace with your actual email). Include:

Description of the vulnerability.
Steps to reproduce.
Potential impact (e.g., data exposure in simulations).
Suggested fix (optional).


Response Time: Expect acknowledgment within 48 hours and a resolution plan within 7 days.
Disclosure: We'll credit you in the fix (unless anonymous). Coordinated disclosure after patching.

We use Dependabot for dependency scans and encourage PRs for security enhancements (e.g., updated SBOM in v46+).
For ethical concerns (e.g., personhood risks in ontological proxies), report via issues with label "ethics".
Thank you for helping keep GRCP secured
