# Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) – V50 Flagship Edition

Welcome to the documentation site for **Genesis Code Protocol V50**.  This flagship release transforms GCP into an AI‑native operating system for innovation.  It introduces an autonomous spark‑generation phase, unifies full and auto runs, extends the phase map through archival/export, and deepens governance and compliance mappings.  Use this index as your starting point for exploring the protocol, supplemental documents and tooling.

## Quick Links

- **[Master Runners Codex – V50](../GCP%20Runners/GCP%20V50%20Supplemental%20Docs/GCP%20V50%20Master%20Runners%20Codex.md)** – deterministic runner contracts for each phase (Code, Legal, SynBio, etc.).
- **[Cartridges Pack – V50](../GCP%20Runners/GCP%20V50%20Supplemental%20Docs/GCP%20V50%20Cartridges%20Pack.md)** – domain knowledge modules with embeddings, lexicons, evaluation hooks and tool bundles.
- **[Charts: Phase & Gate Map](../Charts.md)** – visual map of phases, gates, risk tiers and acceptance metrics.
- **[Requirements & CLI Usage](Requirements.md)** – describes LLM capabilities, dependencies and how to run a session via the LLM or CLI.
- **[Root README](../README.md)** – overview of the protocol, universal commands, phase map and runner/cartridge concepts.

## Running a GCP Session

To run a full session, load `GCP V50.md` into a capable LLM, attach any necessary runners or cartridges, and follow the instructions at each gate.  You can also use the CLI (`CLI Bundle/gcp_cli.py`) to generate prompts or simulate phases.  See [Requirements.md](Requirements.md) for detailed guidance.

## About V50

V50 is fully backward‑compatible with previous editions but makes several key improvements:

* **Autonomous spark generation** (Phase I‑1) bootstraps sessions without requiring a user‑provided idea.
* **Unified bootstrapping and modes** simplify the user experience; full and auto runs share the same gate cards and summary format.
* **Extended phase map** includes Data Rights, EU AI Act mapping, Provenance & Reliability, and Rehydration phases.
* **Enhanced governance and compliance** includes risk‑tiered rigour, ethical auditing and privacy filters built into the runners and ledgers.
