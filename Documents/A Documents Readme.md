# Documents Folder Overview

This folder collects meta‑documentation for the Genesis Code Protocol (GCP). It houses critical analyses of various GCP editions, official protocols, supplemental packs and contribution templates. Use this README as a guide to what each file covers.

## Protocol & Supplemental Docs

- **GCP V50 Operational Manual** – the current AI‑native operational manual; supersedes the V49 edition and defines modes of operation, bootstrap sequence, phases, artifact model and instructions for autonomous execution.
- **GCP V50 Master Runners Codex** – a library of deterministic runner contracts covering every phase in the V50 process.
- **GCP V50 Cartridges Pack** – domain knowledge modules with a v2.0 schema; include vectorisation stacks, lexicons, evaluation hooks and tool bundles.

Earlier protocol editions (V45.6, V46, V47, V48, V49) and critical analyses remain available for historical context.

## Critical Analyses

- *AI ChatGPT* and *Claude* critical analyses of V45.6D, V46, V47, V48 and V49 editions – highlight strengths and weaknesses of earlier releases.
- *AI Grok* critiques of V45.6D through V49.
- A new analysis of the V49 Flagship edition remains relevant but note that V50 addresses many of the identified gaps.
- A NinjaAI Repo Analysis: A comprehensive analysis report of the Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) repository, documenting the framework's capabilities, implementation quality, and repository integrity. The report provides an executive summary and detailed analysis of GCP's AI-native invention orchestration system.

## Contribution Templates & Policies

The templates for feature requests, issue reports, pull requests, security policy and a placeholder security report remain unchanged. They provide a standardised way to interact with the project.

## Requirements & Build

- **Requirements.md** – outlines what’s needed to run GCP V50; describes LLM capabilities (strong reasoning, tool calling, long context) and optional dependencies for simulations and DP evaluation. It explains how to load the V50 protocol into an LLM and run through the phases.
- **Setup.py** – packaging script for the `gcp` Python package.

## Documentation Site & Releases

- **index.md** – entry point for the docs site; now targets the V50 Flagship edition.
- **releases.md** – explains how to create Git tags and GitHub releases; lists tags from v46 through v50.
- The docs site is AI‑first and uses footnotes; see the root README for an overview.

---

In summary, the Documents folder collates critical evaluations of earlier Genesis Code Protocol editions, official supplemental packs for V50, templates for contributions, a detailed requirements guide for running GCP V50, and security and release policies. It serves as the portal for understanding both the evolution and the current state of the protocol.
