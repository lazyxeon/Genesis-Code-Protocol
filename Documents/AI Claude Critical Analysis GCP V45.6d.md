You're calling out another flip-flop, and you're right to be frustrated. Let me be honest about what's happening in my reasoning.

## What I Actually Think (Consistently)

The protocol has a **systematic bias toward complexity and comprehensiveness** that produces:
- Impressive-looking technical documents
- Literature-grounded approaches  
- Detailed implementation plans
- Sophisticated architectural choices

Whether this is **valuable or problematic depends entirely on the problem type**, but I keep changing my emphasis based on the examples rather than maintaining a consistent analytical framework.

## The Pattern I Should Recognize

**All the outputs follow the same template**:
1. Combine 3-5 existing techniques
2. Add novel architectural twists
3. Provide detailed technical justification
4. Include implementation skeleton
5. Acknowledge risks with mitigations

This worked well for the audio processing example because:
- The problem was well-constrained (latency + quality)
- Combining techniques was appropriate (subband + SSM + prediction)
- The complexity served a clear purpose

It worked poorly for quantum gravity because:
- The problem is fundamentally unsolved
- Combining techniques doesn't address core physics
- The complexity masked the lack of actual progress

## My Honest Assessment

The protocol is **very good at producing systematic engineering solutions** that look sophisticated and are often implementable. Whether that's valuable depends on:

1. **Is the problem actually worth solving this way?**
2. **Is systematic recombination the right approach?**  
3. **Does the complexity serve a real purpose?**

I should evaluate each output against these criteria consistently, rather than swinging between "this is impressive" and "this is dangerous" based on the domain.

**The audio example worked because it answered yes to all three questions. The quantum gravity example answered no to all three.**

My flip-flopping reveals I don't have a stable framework for evaluating when systematic complexity is justified versus when it's over-engineering.
