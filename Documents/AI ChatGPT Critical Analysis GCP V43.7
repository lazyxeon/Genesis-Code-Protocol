Got it—here’s a tight, no-fluff critique of your GCP v45.6Delta (Performance-First Edition) with concrete upgrade suggestions and ready-to-paste protocol patches.

Snapshot verdict

What’s strong: clean checkpointing, event-sourced run ledger, adversarial “Devastation Protocol,” metamorphic testing, explicit simplicity/optimization gates (8.4, 8.5) with tooling guidance, and reproducible perf harnesses.

Core issues to fix now: phase ordering around 8.4/8.5, success criteria that are too lax or gameable, stat-sig for benchmarks, API freeze timing vs. simplification, weak governance around AMEND/BRANCH, and missing cost/energy/fairness carry-through into release.

What’s excellent (keep it)

1. Event-sourced ledger + immutable checkpoints. This is the backbone for replays, A/B branch comparisons, and auditability. Don’t touch it.


2. Devastation + Oblivion Gauntlet (Lite). Early adversarial pulses catch brittleness before you scale; great complement to Phase 4.


3. 8.4 Simplicity Gate (KISS/YAGNI) + concrete tools. MI/CC/vulture/deptry are pragmatic bloat brakes.


4. 8.5 Optimization Protocol with baseline→profile→opt→validate→doc. The workflow is right, and the harness examples (pyperf / Google Benchmark) are a solid starting kit.

Critical gaps & risks (and how to fix them)

1. Phase ordering bug: you optimize after productization.
You insert 8.4 (Simplicity) and 8.5 (Perf) after Phase 8 (Productization Hooks). That risks churning API/telemetry after you “stabilized” them. Move 8.4 before 8 (or even right after Phase 3) and run 8.5 before 8 so product hooks wrap the simplified, optimized surface.
Fix below: “Upgrade Patch A—Reorder gates.”


2. Success criteria too lax / gameable.
8.5’s primary target allows “parity or ≤2× slower than baseline-of-record”—that’s acceptable for research prototypes, not for a performance-first edition. It invites “close enough” shipping. Make targets domain-bound and statistically proven (see #3).
Fix below: “Upgrade Patch B—Tighter 8.5 targets.”


3. No statistical significance for benchmarks.
You require baselines and profiles but not variance control or tests of significance. Add: CPU pinning (already implied by pyperf), minimum warmups, N≥20 runs, and a Mann-Whitney U (or t-test) on medians. Gate fails if deltas fall within noise.
Fix below: “Gate C7.Σ—Stat-Sig Benchmarking.”


4. API freeze timing vs. simplification.
Product hooks (Phase 8) generate surface, telemetry, and runbooks. Then 8.4 may delete layers/abstractions, invalidating that work. The reordering in Patch A fixes this; also add a “Surface Freeze” checklist at the end of 8 to prevent drift.


5. Maintainability metrics can be gamed.
MI/CC can improve by splitting functions without improving design. Require ADR notes (Architecture Decision Records) for any waiver/threshold AMEND and a code review checklist to confirm true simplification.
Fix below: add ADR to C8.4 artifacts.


6. AMEND/BRANCH governance is under-specified.
You allow threshold downgrades via AMEND and free branching. Add rules:

Raising bars: single-sign; Lowering bars: dual-sign with rationale.

Branch budget and dead-branch reaper (auto-close after N idle days).
Fix below: “Governance Guardrails.”



7. Cost & energy missing from “performance-first.”
Time is covered; $ / inference and J / inference aren’t. Add cost/energy collection to perf harness metadata and a Pareto card (time, cost, energy, memory) at C8.5.
Fix below: “Perf Pareto + cost/energy capture.”


8. Baseline-of-record is ambiguous.
Define it per domain (“librosa X for audio latency,” “Timsort for nearly-sorted arrays,” etc.) and lock versions + seeds + hardware profile in the checkpoint.


9. Fairness/safety don’t propagate to release.
Phase 0 mentions risk frameworks; ensure fairness/robustness deltas are reported at C9 alongside perf plots, and block release on regressions vs. Phase 5 proxies.
Fix below: “C9 release bar includes quality deltas.”


10. Security & provenance of artifacts.
You store URIs + SHA-256; add signing/attestation (supply-chain: SBOM, Sigstore) for code and datasets to prevent tampering between gates.


11. Language/tooling narrowness.
Python/C++ are covered; add quick references for Rust (criterion), Java (JMH), JS/TS (Benchmark.js) to keep parity of process.


12. Exit/kill criteria not explicit.
Add a “Stop Card”: if after 8.5 speedup < X% and complexity ↑, branch is deprecated unless value justification is recorded.

Micro-templates to drop into the doc

Gate C7.Σ — Statistical Benchmarking (new sub-gate)
PASS if: (a) variance-controlled runs (N≥30) completed, (b) median delta significant at α≤0.05, (c) hardware/profile captured.
Artifacts: raw runs CSV, summary table, significance report.

C8.4 Artifact Additions

Domain-specific acceptance (example: sub-5 ms audio)

If you’re about to run the prompt “real-time audio processing <5 ms,” set domain bars up front:

AMEND {
  "domain_acceptance": {
    "latency_p95_ms": 5.0,
    "buffer_size_frames": [64, 128],
    "dropout_rate_max": "0.1%",
    "quality_floor": "STOI ≥ baseline - 0.01; PESQ ≥ baseline - 0.05"
  },
  "gate_C8_5": {
    "primary": "latency_p95_ms ≤ 5.0 on target hardware profile",
    "secondary": "STOI/PESQ deltas within bounds; no XRuns > 0.1%",
    "stat_sig": {"runs": 50, "alpha": 0.05}
  }
}

Bottom line

v45.6Delta is already a disciplined, auditable invention engine with the right instincts for simplicity and performance. The main uplift is moving simplification/optimization before productization, tightening the perf bar with stat-sig and cost/energy, and hardening governance around AMEND/BRANCH so thresholds can’t quietly drift downward. Apply the patches above and you’ll have a performance-first protocol that’s also value-first—measurably faster, cheaper, and cleaner to ship.
